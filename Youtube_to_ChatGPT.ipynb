        "brought for the show today? KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: Sure. So I mean, as a background, I'm a programmer.\n",
        "8:11\n",
        "And I've been doing a lot of those tools\n",
        "8:18\n",
        "essentially for my custom creation. So I've been using-- I've been creating my own engines, so-called, from-- not from scratch,\n",
        "8:29\n",
        "but using some libraries. And then, I've been-- I had always to create my own tools.\n",
        "8:35\n",
        "And this was really a painful experience to do that for any kind of tech that I've been working with,\n",
        "8:42\n",
        "whatever if it was a library where you had to actually create everything from ground up, or if it was an engine or a tool.\n",
        "8:51\n",
        "I mean, it was always possible. And it gave you a lot of great, great options.\n",
        "8:56\n",
        "But it was a very programming-intensive task. So currently, Unreal brings a lot of new features that allows you\n",
        "9:06\n",
        "to create the tools on your own in Blueprints without using a line of C++ code.\n",
        "9:11\n",
        "And there are multiple things that I'm going to try to explain and show you that will be maybe\n",
        "9:18\n",
        "really useful for you. And you may find a lot of different use cases.\n",
        "9:24\n",
        "But things are way more open now. And creating your own tools has a lot of advantages.\n",
        "9:31\n",
        "First of all, the engine needs to be created in a generic way. So we just have to account for everyone.\n",
        "9:40\n",
        "And we cannot solve very specific problems all of the time. Because some of the problems are very common.\n",
        "9:46\n",
        "But some are not. And if you have this not very common problem that you don't have any custom premade solution for,\n",
        "9:52\n",
        "you can have a custom-made one. And if it's a work-intensive task, it may be, for example,\n",
        "10:00\n",
        "simplified a lot more using custom tools. TINA WISDOM: Yeah. Absolutely.\n",
        "10:06\n",
        "I mean, I for one am very, very excited to honestly take notes on everything you have to show us today.\n",
        "10:12\n",
        "Because the idea of making some of these more repetitive tasks easy\n",
        "10:18\n",
        "to make is very intriguing to me. And especially as someone who doesn't necessarily\n",
        "10:24\n",
        "have a coding background, I feel like this is going to be such great info for so many of us.\n",
        "10:29\n",
        "KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: Yeah. Especially for people like you, as you said, I mean, that previously it was really accessible to programmers.\n",
        "10:39\n",
        "And currently, if you're an artist, and any kind of artist, if you're a designer and you have your own idea for a quest system,\n",
        "10:48\n",
        "for example, you can just create things that help you build that without having to do\n",
        "10:55\n",
        "all the same work all over again. And I'm going to try to show you some solutions to some common problems\n",
        "11:01\n",
        "hopefully today and hopefully inspire you to come up with your own.\n",
        "11:06\n",
        "So feel free to listen, even if you're not a tech-heavy person.\n",
        "11:12\n",
        "TINA WISDOM: Awesome. I'm so excited. I am so excited. And I feel like you're going to be getting\n",
        "11:19\n",
        "a long list, an email after this, from me asking for some very\n",
        "11:25\n",
        "specific points as well. KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: No worries about that. TINA WISDOM: [LAUGHS] Awesome. Well, I'm ready to dive in if you are.\n",
        "11:33\n",
        "KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: Sure. Let's start with it. So what I have here is the simplest possible tool that you can create.\n",
        "11:44\n",
        "And what I mean by that is, so I'm going to-- I call it the simplest tool.\n",
        "11:50\n",
        "But it's rather like a category of tools using some feature of Unreal. And this feature-- let me ungroup it first.\n",
        "11:57\n",
        "I can push it here, I guess. And I'll deselect this guy. I don't how to ungroup Actors in Unreal.\n",
        "12:04\n",
        "Oh, now it's good. So we can now try to select them all.\n",
        "12:11\n",
        "And here, on the bottom, I just have a list of materials. And I have a button that just says randomize material.\n",
        "12:18\n",
        "And if I select them all, it just randomizes a material from this list. I can quickly show you how it's made.\n",
        "12:24\n",
        "But what you can already see here is, this requires you to have an Actor on the scene and to actually perform this action on this Actor.\n",
        "12:32\n",
        "So you cannot just-- you need to select those Actors, go to the Details panel.\n",
        "12:38\n",
        "If you accidentally select another one, yeah, it just doesn't appear here anymore.\n",
        "12:44\n",
        "Because you just need to be very precise with that. So it has its own limitations. But it's also it's very cool thing to do simple things\n",
        "12:52\n",
        "that you need to do a lot or that you really need to do quickly and see the results right away.\n",
        "12:58\n",
        "So-- sorry. It's not around here. Let me just open it from here.\n",
        "13:06\n",
        "I called it just simplest tool. And what it does, it just has this Blueprint event.\n",
        "13:12\n",
        "Let me zoom it even more. And this Blueprint event here, it is selected,\n",
        "13:19\n",
        "that it is able to be called in the Editor. So we're able to call it in the Editor.\n",
        "13:24\n",
        "So it will then-- just checking this checkbox will make it appear in here.\n",
        "13:31\n",
        "And it should appear under its category. And in this case, the category is default.\n",
        "13:36\n",
        "Because this is an event and you cannot set the category here in Blueprints for that one.\n",
        "13:43\n",
        "And you can also see the list of materials. This is just the regular eye icon being opened.\n",
        "13:49\n",
        "So it's instance editable. And it just shows up as well in its category, which is default as well.\n",
        "13:57\n",
        "So and in here, I have just the simplest math ever. I mean, it's not even math to be honest.\n",
        "14:03\n",
        "So what I do is, I just take the material, check if it's not empty-- sorry, the materials list, check if it's not empty.\n",
        "14:09\n",
        "And if it's not, I go and set the material. But you can see, just for the--\n",
        "14:16\n",
        "I go and select the random one and then set the material. But as you can see, there is a lot of other random stuff in it.\n",
        "14:22\n",
        "And I'm going to just tackle that in a second. But just so you know, this and this is not the part of the tool.\n",
        "14:31\n",
        "And this is also not-- sorry. This is also not the part of the tool. And this is just safety.\n",
        "14:37\n",
        "So I mean, if you trust yourself, you can just do this and have it randomize the materials.\n",
        "14:43\n",
        "Of course, this will be connected in here like in this case. Of course, it's better to not trust yourself.\n",
        "14:50\n",
        "So while you can trust yourself, you cannot trust your users. That's the case. And that's one of the things.\n",
        "14:57\n",
        "So this is how we used to do tools in Editor, tools in Unreal, back when nothing was exposed for the Editor.\n",
        "15:05\n",
        "But now, things are being exposed. So a few things that--\n",
        "15:11\n",
        "let me go here. And there are a few things that came with that.\n",
        "15:20\n",
        "To do those, to use those, you need to actually use something that is called Editor Utility.\n",
        "15:28\n",
        "I can show you something in here.\n",
        "15:34\n",
        "Let me see if this goes through. Yeah, it does, I guess. So with introduction of Editor Utility Blueprints,\n",
        "15:43\n",
        "or back in the days it was called Blutilities, I believe. But then they evolved into Editor Utility Blueprints.\n",
        "15:50\n",
        "We now have a lot of different types and classes that we can bring into our game, into our project.\n",
        "15:57\n",
        "And they can actually access Editor functionalities. And some of those things cannot be done in just a regular Blueprint\n",
        "16:06\n",
        "because it will need access to some Editor stuff.\n",
        "16:11\n",
        "But you can still do this using those Editor Utilities. And those Editor Utilities can be used for a lot of different things.\n",
        "16:19\n",
        "And we're going to get a closer look at them. But from now on, just remember that those--\n",
        "16:25\n",
        "there are some of the things, if I'm saying this is the Editor Utility, it means that it was built in a different kind of way\n",
        "16:32\n",
        "than your regular Blueprint. And I'm going to show it in a second. Just to add on top of that, what I just said,\n",
        "16:40\n",
        "this is just a part of what this gives you access to. And you can see, of course, those are looping.\n",
        "16:47\n",
        "So this guy here and this guy here, they are looping. And you can see, they jump from one place to the other.\n",
        "16:52\n",
        "It's not the whole length. But still, it's tens in here, and hundreds, I guess,\n",
        "16:59\n",
        "in here, or at least a lot.\n",
        "17:04\n",
        "Let's take a look also at some of those things that they give us. So I just collected a list of functionalities\n",
        "17:14\n",
        "that you can now do from your Editor that can allow you to actually work on your project using scripts.\n",
        "17:21\n",
        "Because previously, you could do things in your game using the Blueprint. But now, you can actually modify your project in a lot of ways.\n",
        "17:31\n",
        "And not only modify your project, but also influence the work of the Editor.\n",
        "17:37\n",
        "For example, you can load a new map. Or you can create a new blank map. And also, it can save the existing map or not.\n",
        "17:46\n",
        "And if you want, for example, if you want this not to be decided by you but by the user, you\n",
        "17:52\n",
        "can show the dialog where the user can now be asked. You can ask the user if they want to save the map or not.\n",
        "18:02\n",
        "And based on the result in here, you will just be able to check this checkbox or not in your script.\n",
        "18:08\n",
        "So you can see already that a lot of those things that are very useful when you're creating tools, or showing\n",
        "18:15\n",
        "dialogues, loading different things, creating new assets, it is all possible in here. And apart from creating assets, you can also spawn objects--\n",
        "18:25\n",
        "spawn Actors actually, sorry. And you can do it in multiple different ways. For example, this Spawn Actor from Object function\n",
        "18:32\n",
        "will allow you to just, for example, if you drag and drop, let's get back to the Editor.\n",
        "18:38\n",
        "If you drag and drop something on the scene, for example, let's use this guy because I'm going to talk about this in a bit.\n",
        "18:48\n",
        "It's created based on the class of the asset.\n",
        "18:55\n",
        "So in this case, this is a Blueprint. But if we went to, for example, some Megascans stuff,\n",
        "19:02\n",
        "I can just take anything. Yeah, this is a tomb.\n",
        "19:08\n",
        "So it's a static mesh. And what it created in here is a static mesh component--\n",
        "19:14\n",
        "sorry, a static mesh actor. You can see in here, the type is saying StaticMeshActor.\n",
        "19:20\n",
        "And in this case, it's been spawned as a static mesh actor\n",
        "19:25\n",
        "because we dragged a static mesh on the scene. This goes the same way for this node in here\n",
        "19:31\n",
        "that says Spawn Actor from Object. So you get even those things. So that you use the same factory for creating the Actor\n",
        "19:38\n",
        "that is being used when you drag and drop things on the scene. So I mean, these are just a few things that I selected.\n",
        "19:46\n",
        "You can just, I don't know, take a screenshot of this. Or I can later tell you how to access this knowledge.\n",
        "19:51\n",
        "Because I have it somewhere. So I can share.\n",
        "19:57\n",
        "And but those are just the topics for me just that I decided to go with.\n",
        "20:04\n",
        "I want to show you one simple tool that I created using the Call In Editor function.\n",
        "20:14\n",
        "So this is also the simple one. So you can see in here, if I write 'snap',\n",
        "20:19\n",
        "it will just filter out all the rest. And you can see, I have a Snap Direction.\n",
        "20:25\n",
        "I can rotate this stuff. I can do this. And I can set some other things.\n",
        "20:31\n",
        "And for example, if I say Snap, it will just go in this direction and snap it to the surface.\n",
        "20:37\n",
        "I can also point it to the wall. And if I hit Snap-- sorry, yeah, it's a bit low.\n",
        "20:45\n",
        "Yeah, I should just maybe do this. And then if I go Snap, it just snaps the bottom to this thing.\n",
        "20:54\n",
        "So let's quickly go back in here. And we're going to get back to the Editor Utilities.\n",
        "21:00\n",
        "But I had to do this intro now because with the things I'm showing to you, except this very\n",
        "21:06\n",
        "one, are using the Editor Utilities. So this one is just one more showcase just to inspire you.\n",
        "21:13\n",
        "But then we're getting back to the Editor Utilities. So for example, if I select all of those-- and to select,\n",
        "21:19\n",
        "if you have Actors that have an asset in the root component.\n",
        "21:26\n",
        "So for example, in this case there is a static mesh component in the root. You can Shift E. You can use Shift E to select all of those\n",
        "21:33\n",
        "that are using this very same asset. So if I have this red canister, I hit Shift E. And all of them\n",
        "21:42\n",
        "are selected immediately. So you can also use that.\n",
        "21:47\n",
        "It's super useful for me. I found it out when I've been doing that.\n",
        "21:53\n",
        "So I had to select all of those things every time. And now, I just hit Control E. So now,\n",
        "21:59\n",
        "if I just hit Snap, for example, all of them, oh yeah. Those even snapped together. And that's funny.\n",
        "22:04\n",
        "So I can randomize direction and snap them all among this thing.\n",
        "22:09\n",
        "Imagine how much time it would take me to actually place them all together. I can, of course, control it a bit more if I want.\n",
        "22:17\n",
        "So I can reset the location and rotation.\n",
        "22:23\n",
        "And I can also nudge them, randomize direction, nudge again.\n",
        "22:28\n",
        "Or I can actually snap them now, reset location, or no, again, sorry.\n",
        "22:34\n",
        "Reset Location, Randomize Direction, Snap, again, again.\n",
        "22:40\n",
        "And now, I can, for example, Reset Location. And if I nudge it a little bit, it just\n",
        "22:46\n",
        "gives me this nice explosion vibe. I mean, it's something that is so simple.\n",
        "22:51\n",
        "But it can give you so many ideas for how you can use things.\n",
        "22:57\n",
        "I've been just playing around with the ways I can create tools. And this is what I came up with.\n",
        "23:04\n",
        "And I think it's just nice to be able to quickly create those things.\n",
        "23:09\n",
        "So the sphere that we've been using here, it is a--\n",
        "23:17\n",
        "let's just see it here. It is a-- hold on.\n",
        "23:24\n",
        "So it is also a tool. Let me just find something.\n",
        "23:30\n",
        "I didn't remember the category. Unfortunately, I opened--\n",
        "23:36\n",
        "I accidentally clicked on the Visual Studio-- sorry, on the node twice or something. And Visual Studio is opening.\n",
        "23:42\n",
        "So it may block me for a second. TINA WISDOM: Always Visual Studio causing problems.\n",
        "23:48\n",
        "KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: Yeah. Loading Visual Studio. Yeah. TINA WISDOM: [LAUGHS]\n",
        "23:54\n",
        "KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: That's the thing. So let's maybe go to this sphere. Because it should be an empty version of this.\n",
        "24:01\n",
        "And again, what was the name of that? OK, 'geometry'.\n",
        "24:09\n",
        "You can see here, I have this thing called Make Editable. And if I hit this, this guy became a different thing.\n",
        "24:18\n",
        "So I mean, this was replaced. You can see, in here it's a mesh generator. If I go Bake to Static Mesh, I can go back.\n",
        "24:26\n",
        "And in this case, it's just SM_BakedStaticMeshActor. So it has this functionality.\n",
        "24:32\n",
        "So this is how you can actually use this, for example, using this geometry script.\n",
        "24:37\n",
        "So I'm going to explain a little bit about geometry script in a second. But if you are using geometry script,\n",
        "24:44\n",
        "you can actually make a good use of those\n",
        "24:51\n",
        "Call In Editor functions, sorry, because they are very object-oriented.\n",
        "24:56\n",
        "So you want to do your actions on this very object. So in this case, I mean, changing this\n",
        "25:02\n",
        "just by clicking a button in here is very useful. So let's hit the Make Editable.\n",
        "25:07\n",
        "And I'm going to just show you how it works, what I can use it for. And then, we're going to go back-- go into the implementation.\n",
        "25:15\n",
        "So I can, for example, change the radius of this.\n",
        "25:20\n",
        "I can make it huge. I can change the wall thickness. So I guess, to visualize it, I need to go into wireframe.\n",
        "25:29\n",
        "And if I change the Wall Thickness, it just changes immediately in here. And if I change the Steps, it makes it more or less high definition.\n",
        "25:40\n",
        "What I can also do is, I can scale the UVs. Yeah,\n",
        "25:46\n",
        "maybe I can do it just by typing. Or maybe I just remove-- oh yeah.\n",
        "25:52\n",
        "Sorry. No, I mean, I can't scale the UVs. The problem is, this material doesn't use UVs at all,\n",
        "25:58\n",
        "because it uses triplanar mapping. And triplanar mapping is location-based, not UV-based.\n",
        "26:04\n",
        "And you can see, if I-- it does-- yeah.\n",
        "26:09\n",
        "Does it update? I guess it does. I mean, it's just too blurry for now to be able to see the difference.\n",
        "26:16\n",
        "Though this is triplanar mapping. So it doesn't use the UV scale in this case. But you can also see some additional settings.\n",
        "26:22\n",
        "I'm not changing those at all. So this is something that is being saved for me to use later.\n",
        "26:30\n",
        "And I can then, in this way, by using those settings, I'm going to just explain it in more detail in a moment,\n",
        "26:37\n",
        "I can later when I bake it to the static mesh, I pass this structure to the BakedStaticMeshActor.\n",
        "26:45\n",
        "And you can see maybe somewhere in here, that's what I'm having here is--\n",
        "26:54\n",
        "it's called Geometry Script Internal. And it's called that way because I'm trying to hide some categories.\n",
        "27:00\n",
        "And I believe how you hide categories is, you do this here.\n",
        "27:05\n",
        "So in here, I use Hide Categories so that you don't see this when this is just a baked mesh.\n",
        "27:10\n",
        "Because what it contains, this asset settings, it contains only the information about how it was generated\n",
        "27:19\n",
        "and what is the static mesh that we refer to. And this is the generator class that is also keeping this stuff.\n",
        "27:27\n",
        "And also, here, I also keep the mesh settings.\n",
        "27:33\n",
        "And also, this is hidden. Because in case, if we are using this baked static mesh,\n",
        "27:39\n",
        "we shouldn't be able to change those. Because this is just for our reference. If we hit Make Editable, I'm using the same settings\n",
        "27:46\n",
        "to recall this geometry. So in this case now, I can have--\n",
        "27:53\n",
        "and why I do that is, first of all, because the geometry script is running rather slowly compared to just a static mesh.\n",
        "28:01\n",
        "Because it needs to generate this geometry on the go, on the fly for you.\n",
        "28:06\n",
        "So if I go and hit Bake to Static Mesh, you can see basically just the lighting changes.\n",
        "28:14\n",
        "Because now the lighting affects this in a bit different way than if we were using the geometry script.\n",
        "28:22\n",
        "The other reason to bake it, because you just want the geometry rather\n",
        "28:28\n",
        "than in the very-- you're not working on a very specific lighting scenario\n",
        "28:36\n",
        "if you're working on your mesh. So you know. And you just want to have some--\n",
        "28:42\n",
        "for example, if I'm using the geometry script, it's a bit more like this.\n",
        "28:49\n",
        "It's a bit more clear to see. You can see a bit more clearly some details. So it's also useful that it's a bit more lit up.\n",
        "28:56\n",
        "But again, it's not realistic scenario. So this way, you need to just bake it to static mesh\n",
        "29:02\n",
        "so that you can use it properly in your game, and have it properly lit, and have a proper control over that stuff.\n",
        "29:10\n",
        "And this script is super useful and super simple, actually, so what I wanted to say.\n",
        "29:16\n",
        "And let's take a quick look at this. So you can see there is, of course, a lot going on. But most of this stuff is--\n",
        "29:23\n",
        "sorry, is just rebuilding the static mesh. And this is how the geometry script works.\n",
        "29:29\n",
        "So I believe you add, in the Class Settings, no, you don't need to add an interface.\n",
        "29:36\n",
        "You just need to derive from the generated DynamicMeshActor, and if you do, you get access to this On Rebuild Generated Mesh.\n",
        "29:44\n",
        "And in this case, now you can pass this variable over and over to the next node, and to the next node, and to the next node,\n",
        "29:54\n",
        "until you're done-- I'm sorry-- with your mesh.\n",
        "29:59\n",
        "And in here, I'm just creating one new sphere. So it says, Sphere Box. But what it means is just you can create a sphere or a box.\n",
        "30:06\n",
        "Because if you set this to just so many steps-- I'm going to just show you quickly.\n",
        "30:13\n",
        "If you change it to have, for example, I'm not sure, one step, it's a box.\n",
        "30:20\n",
        "So one step will be a box. Two steps will be also a box.\n",
        "30:26\n",
        "I believe maybe the geometry is different a little bit. And then we go into the, I don't how many hedron is it, but it has walls.\n",
        "30:36\n",
        "And now, we have a sphere, because we just used a lot of steps to generate that. So it just smoothed out a box, basically,\n",
        "30:43\n",
        "so much that it is a sphere. And so, in this case, I'm adding one mesh, which is a box, or a sphere,\n",
        "30:51\n",
        "depending on how many steps I set for each axis. Actually, if I spread it out to x, y, and z,\n",
        "30:58\n",
        "I could have probably also created a cylinder out of it. I'm not sure.\n",
        "31:04\n",
        "But that might be something to check out for. So I'm creating one sphere.\n",
        "31:10\n",
        "I'm allocating another compute mesh. So this is just a mesh for computations.\n",
        "31:16\n",
        "So it's not another compute mesh, it's a compute mesh. But I'm allocating another mesh, which is meant only for computation.\n",
        "31:23\n",
        "And it's also-- so this one is the outside of the sphere.\n",
        "31:29\n",
        "And this is the inside of the sphere. And what I do later is, I just subtract one sphere from the other.\n",
        "31:34\n",
        "And this way, I get this sphere with walls. And based on the wall thickness and the radius,\n",
        "31:41\n",
        "I pick different values in here for the radius. And that's it, basically.\n",
        "31:46\n",
        "In here, I just scale the UVs. And after that, I release all compute meshes, because we don't\n",
        "31:52\n",
        "need those compute meshes anymore. You don't have to pass any compute mesh to this function.\n",
        "31:58\n",
        "So you're good. If you want, I believe, you can just release one of them.\n",
        "32:03\n",
        "But in this case, I'm confident. I want to release all compute meshes, because I'm not using anything in my memory anymore.\n",
        "32:13\n",
        "And in here, I have just a little bit of this weird magic things\n",
        "32:20\n",
        "going on that just make sure that there is a-- OK, let's just go through it.\n",
        "32:26\n",
        "I mean, it's simple. So first of all, I check if the asset exists already if I want to bake this to the static mesh.\n",
        "32:33\n",
        "If it does, I'm just updating it, because I don't want to duplicate meshes over and over again.\n",
        "32:39\n",
        "So I just copy the mesh, which you can get by just saying, Dynamic Mesh\n",
        "32:48\n",
        "Component and Get Dynamic Mesh. And now you get the mesh data. And you can just copy it to the asset--\n",
        "32:54\n",
        "directly to the asset based on the path. So as you can see here, I have the baked meshes.\n",
        "32:59\n",
        "And one of them is actually this one. And they all have different names.\n",
        "33:06\n",
        "And then, I can also create a new static mesh asset in case there isn't any of this name.\n",
        "33:12\n",
        "So I can, for example, just rename this mesh in here, and just call it SM_GeneratedHollowMesh.\n",
        "33:19\n",
        "Instead of that, I'm going to call it just 'sphere'.\n",
        "33:27\n",
        "I'm sorry, I cannot write \"sphere.\" 'SphereOf'-- [LAUGHS] 'SphereOfAwesomeness'. TINA WISDOM: No judgments.\n",
        "33:32\n",
        "[LAUGHS] KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: Yeah, right? I'm like, it was like 'spear' or 'sphere'. [LAUGHS] So I call it 'SM_SphereOfAwesomeness'.\n",
        "33:42\n",
        "and Bake To Static Mesh, and bang, SM_SphereOfAwesomeness is in here.\n",
        "33:48\n",
        "So in this case, if I would, for example, make it editable again, and change it to 2 or maybe let's do 5, I mean it's cool.\n",
        "33:58\n",
        "And Bake to Static Mesh, you can see that in this case, yeah, this updated.\n",
        "34:08\n",
        "Sorry. Let's make it a bit clearer from the miniature, Bake to Static Mesh.\n",
        "34:14\n",
        "Perfect. And we now have this guy. I believe if you set this to--\n",
        "34:19\n",
        "yeah, now this is just a UV scale, I guess. Yeah.\n",
        "34:24\n",
        "It's all fine. So the geometry is all good. And you can see we can now just shuffle this around.\n",
        "34:32\n",
        "And yeah. So this is what this does. When I call it, Bake to Static Mesh, this is basically what I do.\n",
        "34:39\n",
        "And the only other thing is, those two things are something I implemented.\n",
        "34:46\n",
        "So this is something to do. But it's not that difficult. It is very long,\n",
        "34:51\n",
        "but what it does is basically, if I go create a new static mesh asset,\n",
        "34:57\n",
        "I just Create New Static Mesh Asset from Mesh. And this is Unreal feature.\n",
        "35:04\n",
        "And I load-- sorry, and I save this loaded asset. And that's basically it.\n",
        "35:10\n",
        "And the rest, everything else, is actually--\n",
        "35:16\n",
        "it shouldn't be called creating a static mesh asset, it should be called bake, I guess. Because the whole other stuff in here\n",
        "35:24\n",
        "is basically just after we saved it, we know that it exists, because we saved successfully.\n",
        "35:31\n",
        "And we can now spawn a baked static mesh asset-- sorry, Actor, which is our--\n",
        "35:39\n",
        "so if I hit Bake to Static Mesh, you can see, this was saved. And now it's been baked into the static mesh actor.\n",
        "35:45\n",
        "So in this case, I can just-- no, I-- yeah, sorry.\n",
        "35:51\n",
        "I'm just-- yeah. In this case, I just did that, spawned this mesh in here.\n",
        "35:56\n",
        "I set the static mesh to what I have saved previously.\n",
        "36:02\n",
        "And if it went right, I can continue on to setting collision profiles, and setting some materials, and also some--\n",
        "36:11\n",
        "saving those mesh settings. So this is where I actually copy this stuff, mesh settings and asset settings, and save it to the other asset.\n",
        "36:19\n",
        "So I just keep those two things in both assets so I can recreate those very easily.\n",
        "36:26\n",
        "And here, I just, in the Asset Settings, I also make sure to set the class.\n",
        "36:35\n",
        "So yeah, because the Asset Settings, it contains the GeneratorClass.\n",
        "36:42\n",
        "By default, it's None. But I built it, so you can actually use-- create a lot of different generators and just use those.\n",
        "36:51\n",
        "So I don't know for whatever reason you might want to do this. But you can.\n",
        "36:57\n",
        "What it also serves as a purpose is that I can now-- I don't need to save this anywhere in this asset in the mesh--\n",
        "37:07\n",
        "sorry, in the-- yeah, in the baked static mesh, I don't need to remember what is my main mesh generator.\n",
        "37:14\n",
        "I just read this from this value if this was saved. So we just went through the whole mesh generation.\n",
        "37:21\n",
        "And it is, the copy is just calling copy on this.\n",
        "37:27\n",
        "So I just do the same thing. The only thing is just two little checks\n",
        "37:32\n",
        "and making sure that the asset is loaded. And in this case, I can already copy this. And if I keep this somewhere in my library,\n",
        "37:40\n",
        "I have already those two functions to just use anywhere else in my project. So most of this stuff is very simple.\n",
        "37:47\n",
        "And all the rest is just making it as useful as possible. You can skip this part if you want.\n",
        "37:57\n",
        "So this is it. And then, the baked static mesh, it does just the same thing. The only difference is it finds the MeshGenerator.\n",
        "38:07\n",
        "And in this case, you can also see, if this is not a valid class, setting the MeshGenerator as default, so I can as well skip it.\n",
        "38:17\n",
        "Anyways, what I'm doing here is I'm making sure it's loaded. And I'm basically just spawning a new Actor.\n",
        "38:25\n",
        "And in this case, again, this is just so simple. There are just some checks that may make it seem difficult,\n",
        "38:34\n",
        "or but I just like to be safe and make my users' life as easy\n",
        "38:40\n",
        "as possible. But actually, the whole important stuff is just those few nodes, and at the end\n",
        "38:47\n",
        "removing the Actor that we're working on right now. So that's it about the geometry script and how I did it.\n",
        "38:56\n",
        "So basically, the only thing to remember is you can keep some metadata in structures\n",
        "39:02\n",
        "and then use it across different instances to go back and forth from the generated to baked versions of things.\n",
        "39:10\n",
        "But it's basically this. So this is it for the simpler tools in terms\n",
        "39:19\n",
        "of just using those buttons in here. But what I can do-- and most of them don't use even transactions,\n",
        "39:26\n",
        "which is undo/redo buffer. And I'm going to also cover that in a sec.\n",
        "39:33\n",
        "But some of them do, of course. But most of them just don't do that.\n",
        "39:39\n",
        "Because, for example, if I just convert things in a nondestructive way from a baked version, to non-baked version,\n",
        "39:47\n",
        "to the dynamic version that I can change and modify, I mean, I don't necessarily need to undo or redo anything.\n",
        "39:55\n",
        "And most of those changes, I can just use the Editor functionalities\n",
        "40:01\n",
        "to revert if I want. Because if I change any variable in here, again,\n",
        "40:07\n",
        "geometry, if I change this to radius to, let's say, 1K. Oh, yeah.\n",
        "40:12\n",
        "This is 100. Let's make it 1K. I can just revert it very easily without making undo/redo magic\n",
        "40:22\n",
        "on my own. So those were the simpler ones. Although this geometry one is a little bit more\n",
        "40:31\n",
        "maybe difficult internally. But in general, the main inner workings are basically very simple.\n",
        "40:45\n",
        "So this is some simple stuff. And let's now take a look at what Editor Utility\n",
        "40:54\n",
        "widgets allow us to do. So previously, to create a new window in your--\n",
        "41:02\n",
        "or just an action that you could call in the Editor, you would have to go to C++, create a module that would be an Editor\n",
        "41:09\n",
        "module, and then compile it, write your own code,\n",
        "41:15\n",
        "and use probably multiple classes for one simple functionality. Because it's, in complex tools like game engines,\n",
        "41:24\n",
        "it happens that you need to use multiple classes to just,\n",
        "41:30\n",
        "for example, create a button. Because in one class, you need to register it. In another class, you need to define some main properties.\n",
        "41:39\n",
        "In another class, you define layout, and things like that. And it's a bit work intensive.\n",
        "41:44\n",
        "If you are working on an important tool, I mean, it's worth it. But if you just want to make your life easier,\n",
        "41:51\n",
        "you're not making your life easier by going and writing C++ code and using\n",
        "41:57\n",
        "it just once. Because most of the time, you just spend more time on making the tool than using it. And in this case, in case of Blueprints, it's much faster.\n",
        "42:08\n",
        "The iteration time is so much faster that you can actually create or modify things on the go without much hassle.\n",
        "42:16\n",
        "So let's take a look at that. Yeah. Tina, do you think it's clear until now?\n",
        "42:22\n",
        "TINA WISDOM: Yeah. I would say so. And there's already a bunch of different scenarios that I can think of that would be helpful for a lot of the tools\n",
        "42:30\n",
        "that you have shown. I mean, even just the very first one with the explosion effect\n",
        "42:36\n",
        "with the snapping. KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: Right. TINA WISDOM: I can imagine in a level design for maybe some kind of magic level or something\n",
        "42:45\n",
        "that's frozen in time or something like that. KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: Exactly. TINA WISDOM: Yeah. Instead of having to place each one individually, just setting up a tool super quickly that\n",
        "42:51\n",
        "can make those sort of geometry pieces for you\n",
        "42:57\n",
        "is incredibly time-saving. So already I'm [INAUDIBLE]. KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: Yeah, exactly. [LAUGHTER]\n",
        "43:02\n",
        "Most of the stuff, if you just have a good purpose to use it, I mean, it is incredible.\n",
        "43:11\n",
        "And one other thing, as you said, about those nudging those things\n",
        "43:16\n",
        "and making those magic frozen in time effects, actually, you can use it.\n",
        "43:22\n",
        "I believe [INAUDIBLE] created this tool at one point, or he wanted to. You can use it to, for example, just drop things with physics\n",
        "43:32\n",
        "and just hit-- click a button and just save this stuff in place,\n",
        "43:39\n",
        "freeze it in time, so that it was distributed using physics. Of course, you need to run your game for that,\n",
        "43:46\n",
        "or at least simulate your game and then keep the simulation changes. But this is another thing you can do, for example, with that.\n",
        "43:53\n",
        "But this is, again, those things that were available for us for a while now. So I created a few other things.\n",
        "44:02\n",
        "And let's start with the Blueprint ones. So one of those is a window that you can open in the Editor.\n",
        "44:12\n",
        "And it has some useful-- hopefully useful features. So let's imagine a scenario first. I have multiple of this.\n",
        "44:24\n",
        "And I'm going to just shift E, alt drag. Shift E alt drag, right?\n",
        "44:29\n",
        "And I mean, I can of course go this way\n",
        "44:37\n",
        "and try to lay them out one by one, and you know. But I mean, I don't think it's very useful, to be honest.\n",
        "44:47\n",
        "So what I created, and what I felt like would be useful, is just have another window.\n",
        "44:53\n",
        "And in this case, it's called ActorDistribution tool. That will allow you to do those things\n",
        "45:01\n",
        "in a programmatic way a bit easier than previously, than just by hand.\n",
        "45:08\n",
        "So how it works is, first of all, I'm going to just drag it here a little bit.\n",
        "45:14\n",
        "Because yesterday, a colleague showed me his tool. And it was all colorful.\n",
        "45:20\n",
        "And it was all pretty and beautiful. So today before the stream, I sat down and when we were doing the sound check,\n",
        "45:26\n",
        "I've been working on this guy, running around in here. So I hope you enjoy it.\n",
        "45:32\n",
        "You can see-- I'm like, you can make them beautiful. I'm just the technical guy. I'm not an artist at all.\n",
        "45:38\n",
        "And I've been looking, actually, for some cool animations of cat online. I'm going to just show you one link in a sec.\n",
        "45:44\n",
        "But I can even click him. And he licks his paw or just sits.\n",
        "45:52\n",
        "And I think, it's pretty good. TINA WISDOM: Good mascot, I'm telling you. KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: And you can add those mascots, yeah, right. I hope it is.\n",
        "45:58\n",
        "I mean, you can add those things to your tools effortlessly.\n",
        "46:05\n",
        "I'm going to just drag it onto here. Or actually, we're going to use this now. So I'm going to keep it a bit more up so you can see what I'm doing.\n",
        "46:14\n",
        "So first of all, [LAUGHS] the cute cat, I hope it's nice\n",
        "46:20\n",
        "and it's visible. By the way, yeah this is the credits. Credits are important.\n",
        "46:26\n",
        "So this is this guy-- or I mean, this guy, this person. And what they said is that you're free to use this commercially as\n",
        "46:37\n",
        "well. So feel free to give him some credits. But he asked for tips. So I mean, I don't know.\n",
        "46:43\n",
        "I'm going to tip them, whoever they are. TINA WISDOM: Absolutely. KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: So yeah, definitely.\n",
        "46:48\n",
        "After this stream, I'm going directly to their web page.\n",
        "46:54\n",
        "So what I can do with this tool is, I can set my screen\n",
        "47:00\n",
        "and my selection set, or just use my current selection. So I'm going to just save this selection.\n",
        "47:07\n",
        "So I can click on other things in the meantime. And you can see here, it's using saved selection, 64 items.\n",
        "47:14\n",
        "If I click on another thing, I mean, I'm still using saved selection, the 64 items.\n",
        "47:21\n",
        "And you can see, I have something selected here. It's distribution type. So you can guess that this will distribute my objects in a way.\n",
        "47:31\n",
        "And if I click on this guy, for example, I can select-- sorry, Set Location.\n",
        "47:37\n",
        "I can also enable Live Preview. And you can already see how the circle distribution would work. For example, I can also select another thing.\n",
        "47:44\n",
        "And I can say, I want to do a-- sorry, a circle around-- toward from this point here to this column.\n",
        "47:53\n",
        "So I hit, set side-- sorry, Set Size. And it just sets the size to the distance between those points.\n",
        "48:01\n",
        "Or if you have multiple things selected, I'm not sure what will happen because it should randomize it.\n",
        "48:07\n",
        "Yeah, and Set Size just sets it to the one. But if you hit Set Location, it will just randomize the location.\n",
        "48:15\n",
        "Oh, sorry. I have just one selected. So that's my problem. Not randomize, I'm sorry.\n",
        "48:20\n",
        "It will average the location. So now it's in the center. You can see also here, in the center of all the columns.\n",
        "48:26\n",
        "So in situations where you have some layout already, you can already place it in your space.\n",
        "48:31\n",
        "So for example, I can put this thing inside. I mean, this is some Japanese monument or shrine.\n",
        "48:41\n",
        "And if I hit the-- place it here, and I can say, Set Location, and then I can say, Execute, it we'll\n",
        "48:49\n",
        "just distribute them around in here. So you can see that it's just one click to click to work on it--\n",
        "49:01\n",
        "to make it work, sorry. And I can still keep working on this selection. I don't even have to keep them selected.\n",
        "49:08\n",
        "I can now, for example, decrease the radius a little bit, because it's a bit too far. And I can hit Execute.\n",
        "49:14\n",
        "And I can keep working on it this way. I can, for example, now, because what I'm doing, I'm keeping orientation.\n",
        "49:20\n",
        "And you can see, it's kind of weird because all of them look in my direction. If I shuffle the elements but still keep the orientation and execute it,\n",
        "49:30\n",
        "yeah, it doesn't work as I expected it to. So let's maybe randomize.\n",
        "49:36\n",
        "Then I guess it's going to randomize it completely. So again, what you can do in this case is, actually, yeah,\n",
        "49:46\n",
        "unfortunately, let me check this again. Because for whatever reason--\n",
        "49:56\n",
        "yeah, hold on. Yeah, it did-- kind of doesn't shuffle them for whatever reason.\n",
        "50:05\n",
        "Huh. That's funny. Let me see. Let me see on something that is--\n",
        "50:12\n",
        "well, it's not that important. But again, let's save the selection. Let's now execute.\n",
        "50:18\n",
        "So our barrel is now in the circle. And if I shuffle elements, yeah, it goes around and around.\n",
        "50:25\n",
        "And it does keep the-- oh, right. Because no matter how I will shuffle it, when I keep the orientation,\n",
        "50:35\n",
        "it's still one way. So they will not change their orientation. It's obvious.\n",
        "50:41\n",
        "So let's instead make them go inside first, not shuffle. Now they are all looking my way.\n",
        "50:49\n",
        "They're just pointing. So I hope you can see that the pattern is very similar on all of them.\n",
        "50:55\n",
        "And now, if I shuffle them and make them keep this, they will each have a different orientation\n",
        "51:01\n",
        "so they look a bit more natural. Of course, they have the same shape and stuff. So you can clearly see, it's not super natural.\n",
        "51:08\n",
        "But if you had, for example, trees in the forest, you can easily do that. Of course, there was some maths involved currently.\n",
        "51:15\n",
        "[LAUGHS] But in this case, I can make them go inside or outside.\n",
        "51:21\n",
        "So actually, there was this Livestream previously on the tools. And I really liked it because it had this feature with the chairs.\n",
        "51:35\n",
        "And my first example was with the chairs. So let me just put a chair in there.\n",
        "51:40\n",
        "And I think if I go--\n",
        "51:49\n",
        "what you can also do in this case is, you can actually hit Control-P and type 'chair' in there.\n",
        "51:56\n",
        "And I believe this is one of those lod3, 5, yeah, I wouldn't--\n",
        "52:01\n",
        "OK, yeah, I probably didn't download all of those. So I can now-- it's a bit more visible, the direction\n",
        "52:07\n",
        "is a bit more visible when you use chairs. So and also, you can imagine having an audience, for example,\n",
        "52:16\n",
        "or something like that. So for example, let's say, again, this is this Japanese monument.\n",
        "52:24\n",
        "And I'm going to save this selection so that I'm working on this. And I'm going to use this as my location.\n",
        "52:31\n",
        "Size is fine. I'm going to just make it a little bit smaller, maybe-- and now I can, for example, do other things, like change the arc angle.\n",
        "52:39\n",
        "And for example, just to show you how useful it can be, very quickly, I can offset it a little bit\n",
        "52:45\n",
        "and make the radius a little bit higher, and then Execute on a copy.\n",
        "52:51\n",
        "And I can do it again.\n",
        "52:56\n",
        "I can make some variations and, again, Execute on a copy. Maybe just make some things in between.\n",
        "53:03\n",
        "But you can see already that if you have some use cases, it's perfect.\n",
        "53:09\n",
        "Let me go to some different distribution. So for example, there is this complex circle. And complex circle, you can see that the settings are being passed over\n",
        "53:17\n",
        "to the other distribution. So the center is still being kept here. So you can-- so it can be just also very\n",
        "53:25\n",
        "easy to use rather than you have to do everything again, over and over. And you can see, in this case, I have this Size Ratio.\n",
        "53:32\n",
        "So I can, for example, do an ellipse and stuff like that. So if you have use cases for this, you can also do that.\n",
        "53:41\n",
        "This works a bit differently in this complex circle. I probably messed up something with the maths. But I mean, again, I've been doing some things very fairly\n",
        "53:50\n",
        "quickly rather than taking care to make it very, very well.\n",
        "53:56\n",
        "But we, for example, also have a Fibonacci sphere. Let me move it a little bit up there.\n",
        "54:02\n",
        "You can see that there's actually-- hold on. Oh, that's a lot.\n",
        "54:09\n",
        "So yeah. Let's make this smaller.\n",
        "54:18\n",
        "Ah. You can see that I'm still working on a different selection set.\n",
        "54:24\n",
        "So I'm going to just select a bit more, Execute. And now, you can see I can create this super nice and even sphere.\n",
        "54:30\n",
        "And if I want, I can now, for example, again, do this kind of-- let me turn this up, again, this frozen in time magic effect.\n",
        "54:39\n",
        "So you can, for example, make them all keep--\n",
        "54:46\n",
        "look outside. I mean, all of those possibilities. We can use a 3D grid instead and make them\n",
        "54:53\n",
        "just go in four by four on the floor and up as many as they can go.\n",
        "54:59\n",
        "So you can see that those things, while maybe--\n",
        "55:04\n",
        "oh, wow. They even do this kind of vector field pattern.\n",
        "55:09\n",
        "Can you see it? I mean, it's super regular-- TINA WISDOM: Yeah. KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: --and how they went. Because I made them go out.\n",
        "55:16\n",
        "That is funny. Because-- that is nice. Because I actually didn't take care of that in this distribution.\n",
        "55:22\n",
        "And it just does default, which is cool. Never mind.\n",
        "55:28\n",
        "So you can see, there's all those things. And I'm going to just go through a little bit of that.\n",
        "55:33\n",
        "I'm not going to cover every node in this tool.\n",
        "55:38\n",
        "Do we still have time, though? How much time do we have? Because I know it is not very time-sensitive.\n",
        "55:44\n",
        "TINA WISDOM: Oh, we have plenty of time. We have-- KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: OK, perfect. TINA WISDOM: --a little over an hour still.\n",
        "55:50\n",
        "KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: Oh, OK. That's good. So that's a good pacing, because I have a little over a half left.\n",
        "55:57\n",
        "TINA WISDOM: Perfect. KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: I'm kidding. TINA WISDOM: [LAUGHS] KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Probably less, so we have time for questions as well.\n",
        "56:03\n",
        "So let me go to this tool. And now, let me find this.\n",
        "56:08\n",
        "By the way, I'm going to make it public on my GitHub, I guess. So or maybe we can share it somehow later on after the stream.\n",
        "56:18\n",
        "I'm happy to do so. So that you can all access it.\n",
        "56:24\n",
        "And just check for yourselves. Because I believe this is how you actually learn.\n",
        "56:30\n",
        "So this is this ActorDistribution tool. It's huge. You can see, it's huge. But what it is, actually, is just this widget.\n",
        "56:39\n",
        "And let me go through a few important things that are to be covered in here.\n",
        "56:45\n",
        "So hold on a second. I'm going to find something.\n",
        "56:52\n",
        "Yeah. Let's do this. So I'm going to show you just--\n",
        "56:57\n",
        "oh, no. Why? So one of the coolest features in my opinion,\n",
        "57:05\n",
        "and this is the whole tool was based on this feature, this and this,\n",
        "57:10\n",
        "actually. So those allow you-- details view and the property view.\n",
        "57:15\n",
        "Those allow you to just put a widget where you can assign an object and a property in case of property view,\n",
        "57:23\n",
        "or just an object. And it will just display all the details of this thing in there.\n",
        "57:28\n",
        "And it just does this. So let me get back to the Editor again.\n",
        "57:34\n",
        "Here, this thing, is just the details panel of one of the objects. And you can see--\n",
        "57:44\n",
        "I cannot quite-- OK, yeah. Not here. You can see in here, I believe, this is the DistributionBase.\n",
        "57:51\n",
        "And this DistributionBase, you can see, it has Location, Size, Max Actors to Process, and Orientation, because you can actually\n",
        "57:58\n",
        "limit how many Actors you want to use in the processing. Because you cannot-- you can use not the full set if you want.\n",
        "58:05\n",
        "And you can see the same things in here. And then, the 3DGrid, for example, you can see it's just a class, another Blueprint class, that\n",
        "58:17\n",
        "derives from the DistributionBase. So it does have still the Location, Size, Max Actors to Process,\n",
        "58:23\n",
        "Orientation, Size X and Size Y. And what it also has, it has a Calculate Location function.\n",
        "58:30\n",
        "And let me just show you how it works. It returns a new location for a single calculation\n",
        "58:40\n",
        "based on the element ID and the amount and the selection set,\n",
        "58:47\n",
        "basically. So you can access the whole selection set. So what I was actually doing yesterday also is, I did--\n",
        "58:52\n",
        "I made it work in a-- sorry, in an iterative way, so that you can, for example, have them all bunched up in one place\n",
        "58:59\n",
        "and spread them evenly step by step, iteration by iteration. But it was a little bit clunky.\n",
        "59:05\n",
        "I didn't want to show this at this stream. It made the whole thing look extremely complex.\n",
        "59:13\n",
        "And currently, what I do here is, I just basically based off an index and size that I have supplied from the user,\n",
        "59:23\n",
        "so I just go through every element. And based on the size and its index on that,\n",
        "59:29\n",
        "and I just calculate the position in a grid, in this case.\n",
        "59:34\n",
        "It's a bit easier, I believe, for the circle. Yeah, it is, definitely.\n",
        "59:41\n",
        "So in this case, you can see what I'm doing is, I'm first of all taking the whole-- so I'm\n",
        "59:49\n",
        "using this Element ID to identify the one that I'm working on. But I'm using this Selection to just know how many items I\n",
        "59:57\n",
        "have in my selection. So it would say, in this case, I go--\n",
        "1:00:04\n",
        "what I'm doing in this case is, I'm selecting based on this ID\n",
        "1:00:10\n",
        "and the number of those, I'm figuring out the angle. And when I-- sorry.\n",
        "1:00:19\n",
        "I just got lost a little bit. So again, in here, I calculate the angle between those elements\n",
        "1:00:27\n",
        "based on the number of the elements. So this is quite easy. This is arc angle.\n",
        "1:00:32\n",
        "Arc angle is usually set to 360. So 360 is a full circle. If you divide full circle by four, you\n",
        "1:00:41\n",
        "have an angle between four elements that you can place along this circle.\n",
        "1:00:46\n",
        "I hope this is clear now. [LAUGHS] Because I got very lost previously.\n",
        "1:00:51\n",
        "And then, if I multiply it, this angle, by the ID of the element\n",
        "1:00:57\n",
        "that I want, that I'm working on, that I want the location of, I basically get the angle of that element.\n",
        "1:01:04\n",
        "So if you have four elements, the angle, 360 by four is 90.\n",
        "1:01:10\n",
        "I hope I'm right. Yeah. It is. And it's 90.\n",
        "1:01:16\n",
        "TINA WISDOM: Which I could confirm for you. KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: And if you-- it is. I'm sure. TINA WISDOM: [LAUGHS] Now there's a-- [INTERPOSING VOICES]\n",
        "1:01:21\n",
        "KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: I was just, it was a safety thing.\n",
        "1:01:26\n",
        "But yeah, I'm 100% sure it's 90. [LAUGHTER] So if you have a circle, I'm looking for a circle now.\n",
        "1:01:36\n",
        "Hold on. If you have your circle, this is my water glass.\n",
        "1:01:42\n",
        "And you divide it by four. You have four points of 90.\n",
        "1:01:47\n",
        "And if you just take 90 and do it like-- for example, you want the second point. So you go once and twice.\n",
        "1:01:55\n",
        "And this is 180. So if you multiply 90 by two, you get 180,\n",
        "1:02:00\n",
        "which is the position, basically, radial location of this point, as\n",
        "1:02:05\n",
        "long as you supply also the size of the circle, which is in this case, a radius.\n",
        "1:02:11\n",
        "And I simplified it. And every distribution has a size input rather than\n",
        "1:02:18\n",
        "different ones having radius, and then\n",
        "1:02:24\n",
        "size a, size b, size c, or whatever you want to go for. I'm just using one single size.\n",
        "1:02:30\n",
        "And it's all uniform in every case. If you want, you can always add your own size to your script.\n",
        "1:02:37\n",
        "It works as well. Just you can skip using this size. Or you can use it as scale. Anyways, the location here--\n",
        "1:02:45\n",
        "oh, sorry. I skipped it almost. I'm so sorry.\n",
        "1:02:50\n",
        "In this case, I'm adding just the angle offset. So offset is just adding some value to some other value.\n",
        "1:02:55\n",
        "I'm just offsetting it by some angle. So I got my angle. I'm offsetting it a little bit if I want to.\n",
        "1:03:01\n",
        "Usually, it's just zero. And what I do is just to calculate the points on the circle, I'm like,\n",
        "1:03:08\n",
        "you should use cosine and sine to do that. It's just as simple. But you can also use Rotate Vector Around Axis.\n",
        "1:03:16\n",
        "I believe this is a bit more compute-heavy because it does it in 3D.\n",
        "1:03:22\n",
        "But I mean, never mind this. I mean, it's a tool that I'm hitting the button,\n",
        "1:03:28\n",
        "not the user later on playing the game-- not the player. So I can wait this fraction of a second while player may--\n",
        "1:03:37\n",
        "it may be a bit different in another case. Of course, you should be optimizing your stuff. But in case of tools-- actually, this is\n",
        "1:03:43\n",
        "one of the things I want to mention. In case of the tools, you don't necessarily need to be super worried about that.\n",
        "1:03:50\n",
        "Because most of the time, you cannot break much. You just break your own development cycle worst case.\n",
        "1:03:56\n",
        "So as long as you use repository, you don't need to either optimize or check your tools for safety.\n",
        "1:04:02\n",
        "I know this is controversial. But I mean, just make sure you're not messing around\n",
        "1:04:08\n",
        "with some sensitive stuff or something, you're not breaking the project essentially. But let's just use source control.\n",
        "1:04:14\n",
        "It's just as simple. And make sure you don't do any super weird things.\n",
        "1:04:20\n",
        "I'm going to show you some weird things that you are not supposed to do, I believe. Or maybe you are.\n",
        "1:04:25\n",
        "Let's get back to this. I'm so sorry for this derail. So after offsetting this angle, I have my angle.\n",
        "1:04:31\n",
        "I have my size. So I can just rotate this vector, which is built just\n",
        "1:04:36\n",
        "off this size in one axis. So I mean, this is quite hacky. But I just get the vector of--\n",
        "1:04:44\n",
        "just the vector pointing into x of size Size by using just this variable,\n",
        "1:04:50\n",
        "I mean, this coordinate. And then I just rotate it around by the angle.\n",
        "1:04:56\n",
        "And I get my value. And what I do later is I add this, because it would be around zero.\n",
        "1:05:01\n",
        "I add this to the location, or I add location to this. And location, as you know, or you may not\n",
        "1:05:08\n",
        "remember anymore, location is what I set by hitting this, Set Location.\n",
        "1:05:14\n",
        "And this is location. If I enable Live Preview, I can move my chairs back to the ground.\n",
        "1:05:22\n",
        "So it just offsets it to the location that I wanted on--\n",
        "1:05:27\n",
        "at, yeah, I guess. Let's get back to this guy.\n",
        "1:05:33\n",
        "I lost it, because I opened too many windows. That was the circle distribution.\n",
        "1:05:39\n",
        "So yeah. So like this is basically how each of the-- TINA WISDOM: That was the most relatable struggle ever is having all of the windows open\n",
        "1:05:46\n",
        "and never knowing where all of them are. [LAUGHTER] KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: Right. Yeah. So I'm just going to kill them.\n",
        "1:05:52\n",
        "It's going to be fine now. Oh no. There's-- OK, yeah. You've seen the spoilers already.\n",
        "1:05:58\n",
        "So yeah. Yeah, now, yeah. OK, I clicked something by accident.\n",
        "1:06:04\n",
        "So this is the whole distribution. It just has parameters, and it has this computation.\n",
        "1:06:09\n",
        "If I really want to, I can also calculate rotation. And this is just a new rotation.\n",
        "1:06:15\n",
        "You can use the orientation and switch on the orientation\n",
        "1:06:21\n",
        "to either to do different things if you want to, for example, the inside and outside of the cube, for example.\n",
        "1:06:30\n",
        "I could maybe have it a bit different, because you may, for example, account the walls to be-- so you, for example, want all the things on the walls to look outside.\n",
        "1:06:39\n",
        "And then, just work this way, or figure it out somehow\n",
        "1:06:46\n",
        "around those limitations, as I said. As you've seen in here, it's all pointing\n",
        "1:06:52\n",
        "in the direction of the last chair. Or it's just pointing out of the first chair, I would say.\n",
        "1:07:01\n",
        "Yeah, as far out as possible in all directions. Which is weird. But I mean, this is how the math that is by default works.\n",
        "1:07:10\n",
        "So you can calculate this rotation if you want on your own. So you have some expected behavior rather than whatever comes.\n",
        "1:07:19\n",
        "And in most cases, this was fine, but not in this one. And again. Back to the ActorDistribution tool.\n",
        "1:07:25\n",
        "Actually, this is just so simple. So what I do here is, I just put the details view in here.\n",
        "1:07:35\n",
        "And I can directly use it. Also, this is just the property view. You can see, this is the property view.\n",
        "1:07:42\n",
        "Probably single property view in here is a bit better way of showing that it is what I'm saying it\n",
        "1:07:48\n",
        "is than the name I gave it myself. But yeah. And again, the details view is here.\n",
        "1:07:55\n",
        "And how you use it, it's super simple. I'm going to just quickly show you. Maybe let's demo it.\n",
        "1:08:01\n",
        "I mean, it's so quick to do it. One thing that is also good to mention at this spot\n",
        "1:08:09\n",
        "is if you create your own editor utility, make sure you create this from the Editor Utilities dropdown.\n",
        "1:08:17\n",
        "So I'm going to show you something. Let's open-- let's create an Editor Utility Blueprint for now.\n",
        "1:08:22\n",
        "And it's going to be Editor Utility Actor. I'm going to just create that one. And I'm going to just create a Blueprint class,\n",
        "1:08:28\n",
        "and look for 'editor utility actor'.\n",
        "1:08:35\n",
        "And I can still select it. It's fine. But it's not. This is a Blueprint class.\n",
        "1:08:41\n",
        "And this is Editor Utility Blueprint class. You can see that there is a difference. And if I click--\n",
        "1:08:47\n",
        "if I right-click this one, it says nothing on the top that interests me. While if I do this, oh, it doesn't either.\n",
        "1:08:55\n",
        "Oh yeah, sorry. Because this is a bit the other way around. If I create it, yeah, it still won't say, it will not work anyways.\n",
        "1:09:05\n",
        "I'm going to show you what I meant by it will not say anything. So 'editor utility widget'.\n",
        "1:09:15\n",
        "Can I create this? Yeah. I can also create Editor Utility Widget from here. You can see now,\n",
        "1:09:20\n",
        "it doesn't show anything I'm interested in. I mean, while this guy, if I create it properly,\n",
        "1:09:28\n",
        "it says Run Editor Utility Widget. So you can right-click this. And it's just the same class.\n",
        "1:09:35\n",
        "But it's a bit different type of an asset. So it doesn't give you the same option. The same here.\n",
        "1:09:40\n",
        "I mean, you won't be able to use the Blueprint class the same way. It won't work.\n",
        "1:09:45\n",
        "You won't know why. So just remember-- remember the right-click.\n",
        "1:09:52\n",
        "And when you right-click, you have to go to Editor Utilities\n",
        "1:10:01\n",
        "rather than to Blueprints. Because it can be super-- you can also, I believe, create Widget Blueprint and then EditorUtilityWidget.\n",
        "1:10:12\n",
        "Yeah, I think so. And it still won't work. So I mean, it is a bit tricky.\n",
        "1:10:19\n",
        "Make a note, really. I mean, I've spent some time trying to solve this in the past.\n",
        "1:10:26\n",
        "So you know. So Editor Utility Widget. Let's create one.\n",
        "1:10:31\n",
        "Let's just add a variable to this. To this very class, I'm adding one variable, whatever it is.\n",
        "1:10:38\n",
        "It's going to be called 'Test'. And it's going to be a material. Why not?\n",
        "1:10:43\n",
        "Let's use whatever, not the simple type. And I'm going to use 'Test2'.\n",
        "1:10:48\n",
        "Let's do it, and then make it a Transform, I don't know.\n",
        "1:10:54\n",
        "So in here, I can just create a single property view. And you can see, it says \"Undefined Object\".\n",
        "1:11:01\n",
        "I can create another one. I'm going to just place them randomly. I'm not going to lay them out.\n",
        "1:11:07\n",
        "Or I am. No, I'm not. Sorry. I mean, bear with me.\n",
        "1:11:14\n",
        "And you can see, there are just two undefined objects. So you can see, in here it says Property Name.\n",
        "1:11:21\n",
        "And I can set this to my Test and Test2 variables. So let's set this.\n",
        "1:11:28\n",
        "So Property Name is Test, basically. If you want, I'm going to show you just as--\n",
        "1:11:34\n",
        "oh, no. It's not what I wanted to do. 'ASlightlyMoreComplexName'.\n",
        "1:11:45\n",
        "So that you know that you just put the name in there, and it works.\n",
        "1:11:52\n",
        "And while it usually works, it doesn't now. Why? So we have those single property views.\n",
        "1:11:59\n",
        "Usually you should call them something, like name them in any way or form, rather than have Single Property\n",
        "1:12:05\n",
        "View and Single Property View 0. I'm sure you know about that. But I'm going to just keep on working on it.\n",
        "1:12:11\n",
        "And I'm going to set an object. And if you set an object, I can actually\n",
        "1:12:18\n",
        "do-- so those set, those functions that have the target in here,\n",
        "1:12:23\n",
        "you can usually plug multiple things into them. And it will just call them one by one in non--\n",
        "1:12:29\n",
        "I'm pretty sure the order is not very defined.\n",
        "1:12:36\n",
        "But I mean, probably it's top to the bottom. I mean, I wouldn't rely on that. And I would test it.\n",
        "1:12:42\n",
        "It's super simple to be tested. So just do it. I'm going to set the object to be Self.\n",
        "1:12:50\n",
        "If I go to Self, and if I do this, let me just-- it's a Pre Construct, and I'm a bit ahead of myself.\n",
        "1:12:57\n",
        "Usually you would do this in construct. And actually, just so you know, I mean, it warns you that you should not use this for any gameplay,\n",
        "1:13:08\n",
        "heavy codes, and some things may happen twice and stuff. So if you're worried.\n",
        "1:13:13\n",
        "I mean, make sure to read those. It should be fine for those tools though.\n",
        "1:13:19\n",
        "And in this case, I'm going to go back to the designer, and it still says \"Undefined Object\". But in this case, if I go right click and Run Editor Utility Widget,\n",
        "1:13:27\n",
        "it already shows me, OK, one is Unsupported Property. I guess, Transform is not supported, or I messed something up,\n",
        "1:13:34\n",
        "because I might have. ASlightlyComplexName, let's see if I pasted it.\n",
        "1:13:41\n",
        "Yeah, probably Transform is not supported. So let's just change this to something a bit simpler.\n",
        "1:13:47\n",
        "I wonder why. Oh, maybe just because it's-- yeah, let's do Vector. Vector is surely supported.\n",
        "1:13:54\n",
        "If I go-- you need to remember to recompile those. Hmm.\n",
        "1:13:59\n",
        "This might be that Vector is also not supported. It's not that bad though.\n",
        "1:14:05\n",
        "I mean, I'm expecting this to just-- that I just missed-- yeah, OK, fine. Yeah.\n",
        "1:14:10\n",
        "So vectors and then rotators. I don't know why they are not supported by the single property\n",
        "1:14:16\n",
        "view. You can, though, use them with the details view. So if you want to use the vector, you can just\n",
        "1:14:22\n",
        "create a tract that will contain a vector and display this as a details view rather than a single property view.\n",
        "1:14:30\n",
        "So you can do a lot of those different things. Now you can select the material. And you can put a value in it.\n",
        "1:14:36\n",
        "I mean, yeah, make it 50. And yeah, you can also add your own buttons.\n",
        "1:14:41\n",
        "And you can make your own cat. So all those things you can do just this easily.\n",
        "1:14:49\n",
        "And also, what is fun about that, is that now if I set this here, let me just add one button.\n",
        "1:14:59\n",
        "So I'm going to just add one button, one huge button without any text on it. And if I click it, what I want to do is--\n",
        "1:15:08\n",
        "I'm not sure. I want to display the values of those.\n",
        "1:15:13\n",
        "So to display those, let's just print them.\n",
        "1:15:20\n",
        "Print String, because yeah, this text is just not necessary in here.\n",
        "1:15:27\n",
        "And I'm going to just do this directly. And also, Append. I'm not-- yeah, you can just do it this way.\n",
        "1:15:37\n",
        "I'm not sure if--\n",
        "1:15:42\n",
        "yeah. I'm not sure if this is going to display. But I believe it is supposed to.\n",
        "1:15:50\n",
        "No, it's not displaying. But what it should do-- yeah, OK. It's fine.\n",
        "1:15:55\n",
        "So it doesn't display in here, even though it's like, yeah, I'm like--\n",
        "1:16:01\n",
        "even though it's-- what is that? Print String, right?\n",
        "1:16:08\n",
        "Yeah. It is Print String. Even though it's Print String, it doesn't display in here because we're not running the game currently.\n",
        "1:16:13\n",
        "I mean, sometimes in some cases, I believe you're able to make it work this way. But I mean, it's not necessary, because you can always\n",
        "1:16:21\n",
        "go to the Output Log. And there is a cool shortcut that used to--\n",
        "1:16:26\n",
        "yeah. So if you're not focused in some window, just elsewhere, you can double click tilde, yeah, tilde button.\n",
        "1:16:37\n",
        "I don't know. Tilde. How do you call it? This thing. Can you see it? TINA WISDOM: Huh?\n",
        "1:16:42\n",
        "Yeah. I could also be saying it wrong, though. KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: This wiggle.\n",
        "1:16:48\n",
        "The console button. TINA WISDOM: There we go. KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: You can just click twice. And basically, it's it. Yeah. Just naming those things is difficult. So if I set AliasMaster\n",
        "1:16:57\n",
        "or whatever it is, and then 128, and hit this button, you can see those two are perfectly fine.\n",
        "1:17:05\n",

        "1:18:12\n",
        "sorry. We can set this material on the static mesh. It's a static mesh.\n",
        "1:18:20\n",
        "If it's a static mesh actor, we get static mesh.\n",
        "1:18:26\n",

        "1:18:53\n",
        "Yeah. I guess you need to set the whole list. So we're going to make-- I guess if you just drag this, it will, yeah, Make Array for you.\n",
        "1:19:01\n",
        "I don't know what this Debug thing is for. But let's just set this. So this way, we'll set this on the zero index.\n",
        "1:19:10\n",
        "And let's see. For example, let's use some of those spheres. Let's select some material, BasicAsset02.\n",
        "1:19:20\n",
        "Hit this. And it doesn't work. Maybe because-- let me just double check.\n",
        "1:19:27\n",
        "Yeah, it works. So yeah, never mind that. The other one wasn't a static mesh.\n",

        "1:19:45\n",
        "oh, I just made one of them right. Because what I should have done is, instead\n",
        "1:19:51\n",
        "of getting one and checking if it's empty, you can skip this and do For Each.\n",
        "1:19:57\n",

        "Yeah. So now I have some of those selected. Hit this.\n",
        "1:20:11\n",
        "Yeah. It was None. So probably, it went back to default. And now, yeah.\n",

        "If you spend some more time, you can just do magic. I mean, I think this is great.\n",

        "And now, what I want to do is I want to add support for the Undo and Redo\n",

        "buffers. So just to show you--\n",
        "1:26:23\n",
        "why did it happen again? Just didn't change my slide.\n",
        "1:26:28\n",

        "1:26:38\n",
        "And there are two things that you are-- actually, three things that every tool\n",
        "1:26:46\n",
        "should do if you want to cover for undo and redo. And one of them is, you need to begin a transaction.\n",
        "1:26:53\n",
        "You need to give it a Context. Context is basically usually just the tool that you're using or just a name, whatever name.\n",
        "1:26:59\n",
        "In the Description, it's usually something that a user sees when they revert something.\n",
        "1:27:05\n",
        "So I'm going to just set this up in a second. Primary Object is usually just null.\n",
        "1:27:10\n",
        "So you can set this to be dependent on something else. And I'm not really sure what's the relationship in here, actually.\n",
        "1:27:18\n",
        "But you don't have to use it, as long as you don't need it. And if you need it, I believe you will know.\n",
        "1:27:24\n",
        "And then, you need to end this transaction after everything is done. But in between, every object that you modify\n",
        "1:27:33\n",
        "needs to be snapshotted or transacted. And the difference between those two is that Transact Object,\n",
        "1:27:41\n",
        "as you will also see if you hover on this node, the Transact Object will give you this--\n",
        "1:27:48\n",
        "will also, sorry. It will also mark current asset as dirty.\n",
        "1:27:54\n",
        "And Snapshot Object will just snapshot its state. So if you Transact Object, you also mark it dirty,\n",
        "1:28:01\n",
        "which means it is also ready to be saved. And you won't be able to close the Editor without at least answering\n",
        "1:28:07\n",
        "the question if you want to save this asset or not. So if you modify something on the level, for example,\n",
        "1:28:12\n",
        "and you want the level to be marked as dirty, you may want to use the Transact Object in this case just\n",
        "1:28:19\n",
        "to account for that. You can also cancel a transaction and pass this Index\n",
        "1:28:26\n",
        "so that the right transaction is being canceled. So you just can keep it as a value or you can just\n",
        "1:28:33\n",
        "drag a connection straight to this.\n",
        "1:28:39\n",
        "So if you, for example, decide again-- so you started already processing something.\n",
        "1:28:44\n",
        "But then there was a problem. And you ask the user if they want to continue or cancel. If they cancel, you can just go Cancel Transaction and just--\n",
        "1:28:56\n",
        "this will just not happen anymore. I mean, all the objects will be--\n",
        "1:29:05\n",
        "all the snapshots will be removed, basically.\n",
        "1:29:10\n",
        "And there is this handy Create Transaction thing. Usually, I'm not using that because you\n",
        "1:29:15\n",
        "need to do those-- you need to go with your wires from out here to in here, or use new events.\n",
        "1:29:23\n",
        "But it's also super useful. So in this case, you already have everything in one place\n",
        "1:29:28\n",
        "except for the Transact Object one. So this, you need to still remember to use.\n",
        "1:29:35\n",
        "And as if you're using-- so in Editor, if you're modifying stuff in C++, if there is a lot more to do,\n",
        "1:29:42\n",
        "there used to be, at least. Probably now, you can just call Transact Object. But maybe you could-- sorry.\n",
        "1:29:47\n",
        "Maybe you could do that in the past too. But I didn't know about that. And I had to mark dirty things on my own when\n",
        "1:29:54\n",
        "I understood that it should be done. And then, also, I had to transact--\n",
        "1:29:59\n",
        "sorry, Snapshot Object one by one. Maybe it was there, maybe it wasn't. So let's implement it very quickly in here.\n",
        "1:30:05\n",
        "And I'm going to jump to the last part of this after we dealt with the transaction.\n",
        "1:30:11\n",
        "So Begin Transaction. Begin Transaction, let's call it-- so what did it do?\n",
        "1:30:20\n",
        "Yeah, 'MaterialChanger'-- 'RapidMaterialChanger'.\n",
        "1:30:27\n",
        "I don't know. I'm just calling it whatever. Oh no. I removed this shortcut. [LAUGHS] So there is tab currently is selecting-- it's opening\n",
        "1:30:37\n",
        "this right-click menu, the node menu. So you can open it by using tab, I believe.\n",
        "1:30:44\n",
        "This comes from different-- Houdini has that, I think, and other things have this shortcut.\n",
        "1:30:51\n",
        "But I mean, I often use tab for jumping in between those.\n",
        "1:30:58\n",
        "So I'm just disabling it. But you can use it. It's quite handy if you're used to it especially.\n",
        "1:31:05\n",
        "So the Description is 'Let's see if we see it?'.\n",
        "1:31:15\n",
        "Now, if I'm going through this For Each Loop, I need to every-- each of the assets that I'm modifying,\n",
        "1:31:21\n",
        "I need to do Transact Object. And one other important thing about this is do that before you modify.\n",
        "1:31:29\n",
        "So because it needs-- the moment where you're calling this it will snapshot this object.\n",
        "1:31:37\n",
        "So if you did after, your undo buffer will have the modified version in it rather than the version from before the modification.\n",
        "1:31:45\n",
        "So just make sure you remember about that. So and in this case, I'm not going to do that in the loop,\n",
        "1:31:53\n",
        "because it would be a mistake. End Transaction we need to call in here.\n",
        "1:31:58\n",
        "In this case, if there was something that, for example-- so you can see, in here I made a slight mistake.\n",
        "1:32:07\n",
        "So I'm actually transacting every object. I need to transact only the objects that fit my search.\n",
        "1:32:12\n",
        "So I'm sorry. I'm just making it one more line again. You can see that there is no extra wires.\n",
        "1:32:21\n",
        "Yeah. This might have been obscured. But I'm just used to doing it this way, just replacing the blocks.\n",
        "1:32:29\n",
        "By the way, did you know that you can just Shift-Delete a node and it stays connected? And I had no idea.\n",
        "1:32:35\n",
        "This is, by the way, I have this whole list of things that, I don't know, you can screengrab it if you want.\n",
        "1:32:44\n",
        "I'm going to just-- this is like my shortcuts. I didn't check all of them.\n",
        "1:32:51\n",
        "I went through the settings and just copied them.\n",
        "1:32:57\n",
        "So that's why I didn't publish it yet anywhere. But you can keep this in mind if you want.\n",
        "1:33:03\n",
        "So yeah. So Shift-Delete can do that for you. You cannot unfortunately just replace those.\n",
        "1:33:10\n",
        "Just, yeah, change the places of them. TINA WISDOM: What a great hack. Well, trick, I guess, not a hack, but--\n",
        "1:33:16\n",
        "KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: That was great. Yeah, right. Yeah. That's a good point, though.\n",
        "1:33:21\n",
        "So Shift-Delete, it does it and it's great.\n",
        "1:33:26\n",
        "One more thing, actually. If you have a Blueprint, for example,\n",
        "1:33:31\n",
        "in here, and you hit Control-E, I guess, it opens the asset.\n",
        "1:33:37\n",
        "If you have this, and you do the same, Control-E, opens the mesh.\n",
        "1:33:43\n",
        "I mean, those things are so useful. It's more, I used to do that, Control-B, find it in content\n",
        "1:33:50\n",
        "browser, double click, and open. It's five more things to do. I mean, probably less. But OK, let's get back to the point.\n",
        "1:33:58\n",
        "I'm so sorry. I can't help it sometimes. So if I were to find out that the whole selection was static meshes,\n",
        "1:34:08\n",
        "I could have just canceled this transaction instead of going through with End Transaction and keeping them in the buffer.\n",
        "1:34:14\n",
        "I could just remove all those, because I don't need them. Actually, they wouldn't be even there. So I believe, this End Transaction could also revert?\n",
        "1:34:24\n",
        "Or doesn't it? \"Attempt to end the current undo transaction\".\n",
        "1:34:29\n",
        "No, yeah, sorry. End transaction and cancel. This is actually worth checking now.\n",
        "1:34:35\n",
        "\"Cancel the current transaction, and no longer capture actions to be placed in the undo buffer.\"\n",
        "1:34:41\n",
        "Yeah, OK. So it doesn't say that. I'm not sure. So I'm not going to-- I'm not going to tell you.\n",
        "1:34:46\n",
        "I don't think it directly reverts all the changes, but it could very well.\n",
        "1:34:52\n",
        "So maybe it does. We would need to check this. It's a very simple test to do. But just didn't do it yet.\n",
        "1:34:57\n",
        "I didn't think of it. OK so now, you can see, just adding this, this, and this.\n",
        "1:35:06\n",
        "So I begin the transaction. I transact each object, each and every object that I modify before I modify it.\n",
        "1:35:13\n",

        "sorry. Create Material from Selected Textures, I can just hit this.\n",
        "1:42:44\n",
        "My hands are here. And I have a material. Unfortunately, I made one mistake, because I\n",
        "1:42:50\n",
        "used this DA texture. And I base this off--\n",
        "1:42:55\n",
        "let me just redo it very quickly for you. I base this off the suffixes. So underscore D, underscore DA--\n",
        "1:43:01\n",
        "DA would say that we want to take RGB from this, alpha from here,\n",
        "1:43:07\n",
        "Opacity from here, because A is alpha. So we say that this texture contains alpha. Use this.\n",
        "1:43:12\n",
        "Use it. Please use it. And it changes by default like this, to Translucent.\n",
        "1:43:21\n",
        "So that's why those are not available for us. So let me redo this.\n",
        "1:43:26\n",

        "So where did-- I haven't used this for so long.\n",
        "1:43:42\n",

        "1:44:09\n",
        "I just was using wrong textures and doing wrong things. So you can see, it lays out a material for us automatically.\n",
        "1:44:17\n",
        "I mean, I've done so many materials that\n",
        "1:44:23\n",

        "1:44:38\n",
        "Normal. I'm not even sure which one is this-- RMS. So R-- oh yeah, Roughness.\n",
        "1:44:46\n",
        "Yeah. I guess I use this. Red is Metallic. Specular-- so RM-- it shouldn't be called RMS, should\n",
        "1:44:54\n",
        "be called something different. But so anyways, I mean, come on. How much work is it compared to, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,\n",
        "1:45:05\n",
        "bang, doing this. You just need to wait a second. And it even opens the new material.\n",
        "1:45:10\n",
        "So you can just Control B, rename it. Oh yeah.\n",
        "1:45:16\n",
        "Exclamation marks. Oh, no. There-- I'm always too-- sorry, I got too excited.\n",
        "1:45:21\n",
        "So yeah. [INAUDIBLE] TINA WISDOM: Honestly, I don't even want to know how much time has been spent cumulatively\n",
        "1:45:30\n",
        "just doing this exact thing. [LAUGHTER] KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: Right, exactly.\n",
        "1:45:37\n",
        "So let me go to one more thing. So it can do more. So because this-- so that, I'm sorry.\n",
        "1:45:44\n",
        "I'm sorry. TestTextures-- let's go here. And oh, sorry. Not the sprite actions, the scripted actions.\n",
        "1:45:52\n",
        "And let's do this. And now, what it does, it even adds a Multiply node in here\n",
        "1:45:58\n",
        "because I used an emissive map. So you can see that this just created a texture for me--\n",
        "1:46:05\n",
        "oh, sorry, a material for me. And which is pretty useful if I really wanted this kind of aesthetic.\n",
        "1:46:11\n",
        "I mean, of course, those are random textures. So this is one of the tools. And this is the more complex one.\n",
        "1:46:17\n",
        "So it basically finds out what textures you have selected. It figures out what kinds they are.\n",
        "1:46:23\n",
        "And based on the actions assigned to the kinds, actually, it's more simple than that.\n",
        "1:46:29\n",
        "Based to the letters in the suffixes, so if you have multiple of those,\n",
        "1:46:34\n",
        "it will treat them separately or as pairs depending on how it's set in the tool.\n",
        "1:46:40\n",
        "And it will just perform specific actions as needed. So in here, you can see it even added a node.\n",
        "1:46:49\n",
        "And they don't overlap. Because by default, they just-- it's super simple to do that.\n",
        "1:46:54\n",
        "And I'm going to just show you the code. It's slightly complex. So it's called material_tools. But I'm going to go through this with you.\n",
        "1:47:01\n",
        "Because it is worse than it looks.\n",
        "1:47:07\n",
        "So what I did is-- maybe first of all, let's talk about Python at all.\n",
        "1:47:15\n",
        "Python in Unreal is just great, just amazing. And I fell in love completely with it.\n",
        "1:47:21\n",
        "Because it allows you to use the good stuff of Python in Unreal where it matters.\n",
        "1:47:28\n",
        "Because Python is great for processing. I mean, it's not super fast, of course.\n",
        "1:47:34\n",
        "I get it. But in this case, you're not doing much computation in Python. Also, most of the things that you want to do\n",
        "1:47:41\n",
        "is either something very simple that you need to do very quickly. But if you want to generate things-- oh, I forgot,\n",
        "1:47:48\n",
        "I wanted to do wave function collapse example for this stream.\n",
        "1:47:53\n",
        "Ah. I didn't have time for that. But I also forgot. So if you want to do something like that, you can as well.\n",
        "1:47:59\n",
        "So you can create a whole generation algorithm for-- sorry-- for your game, for your levels.\n",
        "1:48:06\n",
        "And it can run overnight if you want. Of course, wave function collapse is much faster. But if you want to cover a huge scene, it may take some time.\n",
        "1:48:14\n",
        "So you can leave it to run overnight. It's still less work for you to do.\n",
        "1:48:22\n",
        "I mean, you want to, first of all, save your time.\n",
        "1:48:27\n",
        "And then, second of all, save time overall. Because you can wait for some things to be processed.\n",
        "1:48:35\n",
        "I mean, you can run them on a different machine. So Python allows you to access everything\n",
        "1:48:42\n",
        "that you can access in Blueprints. Everything that you can access in Blueprint. I believe really everything.\n",
        "1:48:49\n",
        "I believe there is even more things you can access in Python than you can access in Blueprints. The only thing is, you cannot use Blueprints--\n",
        "1:48:55\n",
        "you cannot use Python in-game for gameplay. You can only use Python for Editor stuff.\n",
        "1:49:02\n",
        "So of course, there is some stuff that you may not be able to access because of the relationships and references.\n",
        "1:49:07\n",
        "But I mean, there is just a lot of this. And I mean, I'm going to just show you stuff step by step.\n",
        "1:49:16\n",
        "But yeah, let's start slowly. How this works is, essentially, I have an Editor Utility.\n",
        "1:49:30\n",
        "And you can create those Editor Utilities. Let me get back to this, because it's not that super simple.\n",
        "1:49:36\n",
        "And MaterialTools and TextureActions.\n",
        "1:49:42\n",
        "So if I go to the TextureActions and go to Create Material from Selected Textures.\n",
        "1:49:48\n",
        "You can see this. And I'm going to copy it because it's super not readable,\n",
        "1:49:53\n",
        "and paste it in here. And it detected Python.\n",
        "1:50:00\n",
        "That's fine. So you can see, now I do a lot of weird things. But this is just my prototype stuff.\n",
        "1:50:07\n",
        "Actually, you need to have this guy, this line, unless you have this\n",
        "1:50:18\n",
        "somewhere else in the context. You can use Python-- I mean, I'm not going to teach you how to use Python.\n",
        "1:50:23\n",
        "I mean, I want to show you how to use it well for your own needs,\n",
        "1:50:29\n",
        "or and what you can actually do. So I'm not going to go through every step.\n",
        "1:50:34\n",
        "But I'm going to just give you a few steps. But just for the sake of clarity, you can use Python from the console\n",
        "1:50:41\n",
        "here. And if you import something into the console, so 'import material_tools'.\n",
        "1:50:52\n",
        "I'm not sure if this is very well visible in here. I'm going to--\n",
        "1:50:59\n",
        "So let me just go to this console. It may be a bit more visible.\n",
        "1:51:05\n",
        "So this says Python in here. I'm going to clear my log. And I'm going to now import material_tools.\n",
        "1:51:11\n",
        "And also, I'm just going to copy this, because I just-- sorry. I don't want to spend much time on this, and go to the TestTextures,\n",
        "1:51:20\n",
        "and select those two, for example, again. And if I'm going to just write-- yeah.\n",
        "1:51:25\n",
        "I have them selected. Just have in mind that I have them selected. If I'm going to just copy this here, I\n",
        "1:51:31\n",
        "don't need to rewrite the import material_tools, because it should just generate my things.\n",
        "1:51:37\n",
        "So you can just call those functions directly from your console. But I mean, it's not that useful.\n",
        "1:51:44\n",
        "Because you would need to go to the console again and again. And it's sometimes easier if you already have to select a few assets,\n",
        "1:51:51\n",
        "just right-click them and select from this Scripted Asset Actions. And those scripted actions is basically Editor--\n",
        "1:51:59\n",
        "sorry, Editor Utility Asset Actions. Or they may be called Asset Actions, I'm not 100% sure.\n",
        "1:52:04\n",
        "But yeah. Let me just quickly then explain what's going on here. So this just allows us to use the material_tools.\n",
        "1:52:13\n",
        "And those two lines, let's leave them as they are.\n",
        "1:52:19\n",
        "The reload-- and so, this allows us to use this, reload. And this allows us to use this, material_tools.\n",
        "1:52:27\n",
        "So you need this to use this. You need this to use this. And this you use.\n",
        "1:52:32\n",
        "Because if you save your asset, you don't want to manually write 'importlib import *'.\n",
        "1:52:41\n",
        "So \"from importlib import *\", So import all. And then \"reload(material_tools)\", or just reload material tools\n",
        "1:52:49\n",

        "2:01:37\n",
        "We can get back from here. So this is a lot of things about how you use Python. But there is one more. And if you go in your Editor and select Editor Properties,\n",
        "2:01:47\n",

        "2:02:51\n",

        "2:02:58\n",
        "called autocomplete in English. It's a bit different in Polish though. OK, fine, makes sense. [LAUGHTER]\n",
        "2:03:04\n",
        "So autoComplete. And I add those paths in here, so that I get both my Linter happy, and my--\n",
        "2:03:13\n",
        "this is for my Linter, so for something that checks my code for validity. And this is for my autocomplete.\n",
        "2:03:23\n",
        "And I add those two paths. I don't think I have to add both of them. I mean, I messed up this config a few times.\n",
        "2:03:30\n",
        "And then I was like, OK, it works now. I don't know what I changed. So let's leave it this way.\n",
        "2:03:37\n",
        "So yeah. So this is how you actually make this. And if you download this whole thing and open in Visual Studio,\n",
        "2:03:43\n",
        "and you have those extensions installed for Python, so I'm not even sure if you have to have all of those.\n",
        "2:03:49\n",
        "I'm pretty sure I'm using just one of those. I think I'm not using Pylance. Maybe I am.\n",
        "2:03:55\n",
        "I'm not sure if one is Linter and the other is something else, I guess. I'm not-- never mind.\n",
        "2:04:01\n",
        "I'm like, I did it a while ago. It worked. And I was so happy. So I downloaded Pylance, Pylint, and Python.\n",
        "2:04:06\n",
        "And made sure that in my settings JSON. And those settings are actually for this workspace. So if you download it, you will have those settings already.\n",
        "2:04:14\n",
        "It will already take it into account. The only thing you need to do is set in your Editor Preferences the Developer Mode, because otherwise, you\n",
        "2:04:21\n",
        "won't have this file in here. And this is a plugin, the content that I'm sharing.\n",
        "2:04:32\n",
        "What is this? Oh, yeah. I was trying to do different things. Never mind. These are plugins.\n",
        "2:04:38\n",
        "They are plugins. I was afraid I lost plugins. So let's quickly go through this.\n",
        "2:04:44\n",
        "So I can just explain the concept to you. Because it's a lot of code.\n",
        "2:04:49\n",
        "But it's rather simple. Maybe I can make it a little smaller so we can see a bit more. So the core of this code is here.\n",
        "2:04:56\n",
        "So I first create an empty material. And this is some code to do that. And if I will-- ah, OK.\n",
        "2:05:02\n",
        "Maybe this is the core, actually. So first I create an empty material, which you can see how to do in here.\n",
        "2:05:10\n",
        "It's a bit of work. But actually, most of this is just making sure the path is fine and the name is all right.\n",
        "2:05:16\n",
        "So I'm creating a unique asset name, which you can do with Python very easily using asset tools.\n",
        "2:05:22\n",
        "You can then split the name so that path is separate and the name is separate.\n",
        "2:05:27\n",
        "And then create an asset of the name and path and type material using MaterialFactoryNew().\n",
        "2:05:35\n",
        "Then, and if I have this, if this asset exists,\n",
        "2:05:40\n",
        "I just load this asset because I don't need to create a new one. So yeah, but most of the times, it won't.\n",
        "2:05:46\n",
        "I mean, maybe this is a risky one because it can overwrite some material. I don't know.\n",
        "2:05:51\n",
        "Anyways, it actually always creates a unique name and the asset doesn't exist.\n",
        "2:05:57\n",
        "So I'm quite confident this is even, I mean, useless. You don't need to check this. So but I do, just for sake of safety.\n",
        "2:06:05\n",
        "I don't know. I usually just prefer to have those checks, especially if this is not\n",
        "2:06:10\n",
        "a performance heavy task. If it is, I can optimize those checks out.\n",
        "2:06:17\n",
        "But yeah. Then when I have that loaded, I get the selected assets.\n",
        "2:06:25\n",
        "And basically, if it's a texture, I apply a texture. And applying the texture looks like this.\n",
        "2:06:33\n",
        "So it takes-- it creates a sampler-- create_material_expression(),\n",
        "2:06:39\n",
        "the expression which is sampler. This is my position. So I just use this super simple calculation of positions.\n",
        "2:06:45\n",
        "And I just made sure that all the nodes are 500 units to the left,\n",
        "2:06:51\n",
        "and the multiply nodes are-- sorry.\n",
        "2:06:58\n",
        "Are twice as much, I guess. I mean, I guess there is a bit-- or maybe I'm just adding this to the-- ah, yeah.\n",
        "2:07:04\n",
        "I might be adding. So I might actually have done it a bit nicer. So that's the y position-- the x position is being selected properly.\n",
        "2:07:14\n",
        "So sorry about that. But yeah, no. I mean, I think there is something funky with this.\n",
        "2:07:22\n",
        "So all of them are on x minus 500. And then I do something like divided by two,\n",
        "2:07:27\n",
        "and then set the position for the other one. I'm not going to look for this now. But it doesn't matter that much.\n",
        "2:07:33\n",
        "So I just create a new material expression. And this is a texture sampler.\n",
        "2:07:41\n",
        "So I just create the sampler. And then, based on the suffixes-- so I split the suffix\n",
        "2:07:47\n",
        "into different parts. And based on that, I check if parts of the--\n",
        "2:07:58\n",
        "if parts of this are available in the suffix. And this is my actions. And what I do is, I basically go and call execute() on each of those.\n",
        "2:08:08\n",
        "And those actions determine what happens with my textures. And let me now go quickly through this system.\n",
        "2:08:15\n",
        "So the whole thing from actions right to here is just handling different texture types.\n",
        "2:08:25\n",
        "So I create a base class for actions in here. And then I just go and derive from it in every other action.\n",
        "2:08:34\n",
        "I also have-- so there is this action called CreateConnection.\n",
        "2:08:41\n",
        "And CreateConnection it's just, basically, it just connects one node to the other.\n",
        "2:08:47\n",
        "And this CreateConnection thing is also able to be scaled. So this is the scaled one is the one that has the multiply node.\n",
        "2:08:56\n",
        "And it's actually hardcoded to -250, that's just so you know.\n",
        "2:09:01\n",
        "I hardcoded this. I mean, you could have done it a bit nicer though.\n",
        "2:09:07\n",
        "And there are different actions like CreateConnection, CreateConnectionScaled SetProperty, and SetSamplerType.\n",
        "2:09:14\n",
        "So SetProperty just allows you to set a property on the material\n",
        "2:09:21\n",
        "itself. So for example, you can set blend_mode. If this is alpha, if it contains \"A\", it would go blend_mode.\n",
        "2:09:29\n",
        "Although if it contains \"AO\", \"AO\" will be discarded, and the \"A\" won't be taken into account.\n",
        "2:09:36\n",
        "Just so you know. I mean, it goes step by step. I just decided to go this way. So you can see, I can set the property, which can say,\n",
        "2:09:43\n",
        "for example, set-- send-- sorry, SetProperty 'blend_mode' to this. CreateConnection 'RGB' from this texture.\n",
        "2:09:50\n",
        "So you can see those-- hold on. You can see this, RGB connects RGB to something,\n",
        "2:10:02\n",
        "like for example, Base Color. And A to Opacity. Because if it's DA, it's diffuse and alpha.\n",
        "2:10:09\n",
        "So I just do this and created those actions, which are super simple. You can go by them one by one and see and take a look.\n",
        "2:10:17\n",
        "But it's really not that complex. SetProperty just calls set_editor_property().\n",
        "2:10:23\n",
        "And the only other thing is init, which allows me to set just the property and the value in here.\n",
        "2:10:31\n",
        "This is this and this, and save them to the variables. And that's it. And it just calls this thing.\n",
        "2:10:37\n",
        "This does the same. And I did something. And this does the same, basically.\n",
        "2:10:45\n",
        "So this init just fills out those values with the same values with the same name.\n",
        "2:10:52\n",
        "So the same variables with values of the same names, let's say that.\n",
        "2:10:57\n",
        "And then execute() just does some sequence of actions. And I go just through each of them and call those.\n",
        "2:11:03\n",
        "And it generates my material very easily with just one click. One last thing that I have for you.\n",
        "2:11:10\n",
        "And one last recent thing that I have for you.\n",
        "2:11:16\n",
        "And there is one last hack that I just made. But I'm not going to go too deep into the hack.\n",
        "2:11:22\n",
        "For example, I created this-- sorry, with-- yeah. So let's close.\n",
        "2:11:28\n",
        "Yeah. I'm not sure if you can close all tabs. Probably you can somehow.\n",
        "2:11:36\n",
        "With materials, you always need to apply or not. I'm not sure.\n",
        "2:11:42\n",
        "Yeah, OK. Let this close, let this close, and this.\n",
        "2:11:50\n",
        "OK, yeah. So when I select any of those Quixel, three Quixel textures\n",
        "2:11:57\n",
        "from this rusty metal barrel, for example.\n",
        "2:12:04\n",
        "If I select those, and right-click, and go Scripted Asset Actions > UtilityToolkit > Create Material Instance from Selected Textures--\n",
        "2:12:14\n",
        "yeah. The default one, this is the one that I want to show you first. Create a material instance, it creates a Quixel material instance\n",
        "2:12:22\n",
        "that you can use directly in here. And the other-- the only thing that you have to change,\n",
        "2:12:29\n",
        "if you're an artist and you created the textures, is just those values that you always just need\n",
        "2:12:35\n",
        "to put by hand unless you just create a config file and load it together with the texture. But this way, you can see that, for example,\n",
        "2:12:44\n",
        "if I want to create a texture for this graveyard-- for this, sorry, tomb,\n",
        "2:12:51\n",
        "I can open this as well. I can create Scripted Asset Actions > UtilityToolkit > Create Default Material Instance from Selected Textures.\n",
        "2:12:57\n",
        "And let me just pick this as the preview. And I don't know, I mean, it looks pretty good to me.\n",
        "2:13:06\n",
        "Doesn't it? I mean, I'm sure there are some values that are different. But it's essentially the same material instance.\n",
        "2:13:14\n",
        "And this code is even simpler, like even simpler. I mean, the other one was quite complex. But this one, I mean, I went forward and added also an option to ask.\n",
        "2:13:25\n",
        "Because it was just so simple. I made it in 30 lines, the base version. And then I added some whistles and other things.\n",
        "2:13:35\n",
        "So if you actually go here, and Scripted Asset Actions > UtilityToolkit > Create Material Instance from Selected Textures, this pops up.\n",
        "2:13:44\n",
        "And you can select the base material for those. So you can, for example, go Default_Fuzz_Material.\n",
        "2:13:52\n",
        "I have no idea what it does, because I'm not an artist. I don't even care really, because it's just some specific case.\n",
        "2:14:01\n",
        "I just want to see if it works. And it does. So it's, I don't know.\n",
        "2:14:08\n",
        "I'm super proud of this one. Yeah, this is a bit fuzzy, I can see.\n",
        "2:14:13\n",
        "So maybe this is what it meant. It's a bit noisy.\n",
        "2:14:20\n",
        "Fine. So let's quickly-- so you've seen that dialog. So I can right-click those again,\n",
        "2:14:26\n",
        "Scripted Asset Actions > UtilityToolkit. Not default, but Create Material Instance from Selected Textures. This pops up.\n",
        "2:14:31\n",
        "And I can just select any material. So this way, as long as you have some naming convention in your project,\n",
        "2:14:38\n",
        "you can use this right away. Because except for the fact that in here,\n",
        "2:14:44\n",
        "I just prepared this for Quixel. So I created this suffix_to_parameter_map.\n",
        "2:14:50\n",
        "And so, let's take a look.\n",
        "2:14:55\n",
        "So this is a suffix. It's \"_D\". And parameter is Albedo. So the same goes for Metalness.\n",
        "2:15:04\n",
        "And Metalness goes to-- yeah. Nothing goes here, because nothing was metallic.\n",
        "2:15:11\n",
        "But also, here is a normal. So in this case, I believe there was three textures. No, also two, because one of them just doesn't fit anything.\n",
        "2:15:20\n",
        "I believe \"DpR\", yeah, I just didn't have any of those suffixes.\n",
        "2:15:25\n",
        "But you can just-- \"R\" can be \"DR\", \"R\" can be \"DpR\", \"R\" can be something else as well.\n",
        "2:15:33\n",
        "So you can just have those here. And as long as-- oh, yeah.\n",
        "2:15:38\n",
        "I made a mistake. So \"DpR\", \"DR\", sorry, so that you just map the different suffixes\n",
        "2:15:45\n",
        "to one parameter. And I mean, you can create multiple of those and it should work just fine.\n",
        "2:15:51\n",
        "And the whole magic in here that happens is just create_material_instance_from_textures().\n",
        "2:15:57\n",
        "So it's first checking to-- if the base material is being given, and if it's empty, just ask.\n",
        "2:16:09\n",
        "So this is the few lines I added at the very end.\n",
        "2:16:15\n",
        "And also, this function. So this function is-- it loads the dialog helper.\n",
        "2:16:22\n",
        "So what I did in here is, actually, I used--\n",
        "2:16:32\n",
        "[INAUDIBLE] Yeah, there is somewhere there there's a dialog helper.\n",
        "2:16:37\n",
        "BaseMaterialSelectDialogHelper. And what it does, it basically has a default value of the default material.\n",
        "2:16:43\n",
        "And it just contains one material. That's it. Because what you can do in Python, you can for example,\n",
        "2:16:49\n",
        "show_object_details_view for-- as a dialog. So if you want, you can create an object, ask a user to fill it out,\n",
        "2:16:58\n",
        "and use this data right away from just a pop-up dialog. So I mean, this is just so easy.\n",
        "2:17:05\n",
        "And those options, you can even skip those. And it should be fine.\n",
        "2:17:12\n",
        "So the code can be even simpler because you can get rid of this options, and this line, and all this stuff.\n",
        "2:17:19\n",
        "But other than that, I'm just creating a new object of this dialog helper type. This is where I loaded this class.\n",
        "2:17:25\n",
        "And to load a class, you need to do underscore C, as if you would do in C++ if you want to load a Blueprint class.\n",
        "2:17:32\n",
        "So just remember about that. And yeah. And just like setting the Editor, so I just\n",
        "2:17:37\n",
        "get the Editor Property called Material, which is my base material. I get the path. And I return those two things, the result and the path.\n",
        "2:17:47\n",
        "So result and the path are here. I just-- and basically, then I just create new material instance.\n",
        "2:17:55\n",
        "And creating of a new material instance is just the same thing that I did in the past with the materials.\n",
        "2:18:02\n",
        "And the only difference is MaterialInstanceConstant instead of Material.\n",
        "2:18:07\n",
        "And MaterialInstanceConstantFactoryNew() instead of MaterialFactoryNew(). That's it.\n",
        "2:18:12\n",
        "Probably there is something else as well, because we have the base material that we have to find assets and set this instance parent for this to work.\n",
        "2:18:22\n",
        "But you can do even those things. I mean, this is just so crazy. That's you're able to mess with those things\n",
        "2:18:28\n",
        "just from some simple like few letters that you just put together in the meantime,\n",
        "2:18:34\n",
        "where you were thinking, what kind of cool tool I can just create? So it looks scary, while it's super, super simple to use.\n",
        "2:18:44\n",
        "And it just grows as you use it. And then, the last thing is just, I go through the suffixes and suffix\n",
        "2:18:50\n",
        "to parameter map. And I just check if the suffix is in the map,\n",
        "2:18:55\n",
        "I just continue and set the material instance texture parameter value to this parameter.\n",
        "2:19:04\n",
        "So this is it from the important stuff. The last time little thing, because someone told me they created a viewport.\n",
        "2:19:11\n",
        "Actually two people told me. So I also wanted to create a viewport. And you can do this. You can even do multiple different things.\n",
        "2:19:18\n",
        "Sorry, OBS is killing this now. But this is something I want to just quickly show you.\n",
        "2:19:27\n",
        "So yeah, I'm really bad on performance. But I mean, just a few minutes ago it was fine.\n",
        "2:19:34\n",
        "If I-- yeah, all right. I don't think I can showcase this very well with this setup.\n",
        "2:19:42\n",
        "Maybe if I dock it. So I didn't even pay attention to the aspect ratio.\n",
        "2:19:48\n",
        "You can check this out on your own. I'm going to upload this tonight. So check it tomorrow morning. Because tonight, maybe in 12 hours very well for me.\n",
        "2:19:58\n",
        "So run Editor Utility Blue-- sorry I started reading things rather than telling you what I wanted to tell.\n",
        "2:20:05\n",
        "So I didn't take care of the aspect ratio at all. You can move this camera. I'm not sure why it doesn't do anything at this point.\n",
        "2:20:13\n",
        "But you can both rotate it and move it with your mouse. It may be something connected to the inputs.\n",
        "2:20:21\n",
        "But I had this problem in the past, but I expect this just to be poor frame rate base due to the\n",
        "2:20:28\n",
        "OBS running on quite high settings, I guess. I don't know.\n",
        "2:20:34\n",
        "So it doesn't work. But you could-- oh, wow.\n",
        "2:20:44\n",
        "I guess it-- hold on. No, no.\n",
        "2:20:49\n",
        "I cannot make it work. So you're going to need to check it for yourself.\n",
        "2:20:54\n",
        "But you can actually create a new separate viewport. If you dock it, though, in this way, I created it.\n",
        "2:21:02\n",
        "It won't work. It will just behave as it behaves now.\n",
        "2:21:08\n",
        "But if I just-- I'm so sorry I cannot show it to you.\n",
        "2:21:14\n",
        "Yeah. Doesn't work on either window. So check it out on your own.\n",
        "2:21:20\n",
        "Because currently, I don't know why, it just-- yeah. Probably the OBS.\n",
        "2:21:26\n",
        "I'm going to just quickly tell you how it happened. So I'm just using a render target. And there is an Actor that I spawn in the level.\n",
        "2:21:34\n",
        "Whenever this is visible, there is this Actor called Viewport--\n",
        "2:21:43\n",
        "ViewportSceneCapture. And you can-- oh, yeah. It updated now.\n",
        "2:21:50\n",
        "Something's going on with-- I'm guessing this is just optimizing it out. So I cannot show it to you very well.\n",
        "2:21:57\n",
        "Fine. Never mind that. So yeah. What it does, basically, it shows you a texture\n",
        "2:22:05\n",
        "that is being generated by this guy and-- by this camera. And this camera actually--\n",
        "2:22:12\n",
        "yeah. Doesn't work. I made it yesterday evening. And maybe something wrong with it.\n",
        "2:22:19\n",
        "The only thing is, this camera has this viewport render target assigned. And then this material--\n",
        "2:22:29\n",
        "not this material. This is the camera material, I'm sorry. M_Viewport, it just does some weird stuff.\n",
        "2:22:34\n",
        "So we don't need all this. We can just skip it. And if I go like this.\n",
        "2:22:40\n",
        "And if I now spawn the window, yeah, it broke so badly now.\n",
        "2:22:47\n",
        "I'm so sorry. Just doesn't want to update the camera.\n",
        "2:22:52\n",
        "I'm going to-- I'm not sure if we have time for questions and stuff. But I'm happy to answer any.\n",
        "2:22:59\n",
        "And in the meantime, I'm going to restart the Editor and try to make it run.\n",
        "2:23:05\n",
        "So just, you know. TINA WISDOM: [LAUGHS] Yeah. You got to love these live tech demos, right?\n",
        "2:23:12\n",
        "There's always something that doesn't want to play nice. KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: Right. No.\n",
        "2:23:17\n",
        "I even-- so in development, it's super useful, especially if you're working on tools, it's super, super useful\n",
        "2:23:24\n",
        "to have access to something like restarting the Editor very quickly. Because now to do that, I have to-- oh.\n",
        "2:23:33\n",
        "It updated though. It did update. And it's not that colorful anymore.\n",
        "2:23:38\n",
        "So you can see, I mean, this is just my weird stuff. Anyways, so what I did is, I created a--\n",
        "2:23:46\n",
        "yeah. Because it was us only there. I'm sorry you didn't see that.\n",
        "2:23:52\n",
        "Again, let's just quickly show you. Maybe it will work.\n",
        "2:23:59\n",
        "Yeah, OK. It shows, it updates, but it doesn't work yet. So let's get back to our faces, I guess.\n",
        "2:24:05\n",
        "I'm going to just restart the Editor in the meantime. And so, what I did in one of the toolsets\n",
        "2:24:10\n",
        "that I have is just a restart Editor here in file button, which just restarts your Editor.\n",
        "2:24:16\n",
        "Because there is this functionality in the Editor. You cannot do that with Blueprints only, unfortunately.\n",
        "2:24:22\n",
        "So I'm not showcasing it here. But yeah.\n",
        "2:24:28\n",
        "So I hope it was quite clear-ish. And that you guys had something to take out of this.\n",
        "2:24:40\n",
        "TINA WISDOM: [LAUGHS] Absolutely. Yeah, there was so much great information that all came out of this.\n",
        "2:24:46\n",
        "Honestly, I even personally learned so much. And there's so many different use cases\n",
        "2:24:52\n",
        "that I can think of where these tools would be useful. And it is stuff where you wouldn't necessarily always\n",
        "2:24:58\n",
        "think about specifically making something for it. But I mean, I can't--\n",
        "2:25:04\n",
        "I don't even want to think about how much time I have spent building materials, and placing repetitive assets,\n",
        "2:25:13\n",
        "like the chairs, for example, that in a theater, or an auditorium\n",
        "2:25:19\n",
        "would be an unreasonable amount of time. [LAUGHS] KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: Right.\n",
        "2:25:24\n",
        "TINA WISDOM: So stuff like that it's amazing. KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: Exactly. Exactly. You need those things.\n",
        "2:25:29\n",
        "I mean, to do something like to place thousands of objects, I mean, you can copy them.\n",
        "2:25:35\n",
        "But then select the ones that you want to select out of the ones that are there already.\n",
        "2:25:41\n",
        "I mean, there's so many different things you can do.\n",
        "2:25:47\n",
        "Unfortunately, this viewport-- oh! Is this the reason?\n",
        "2:25:53\n",
        "Let me-- oh no. Yes. Can we show it? I'm going to tell you what happened.\n",
        "2:26:02\n",
        "So I didn't notice. I'm not sure if my face is up there on the left now. OK, this is something I can move around.\n",
        "2:26:08\n",
        "OK, that's fine. So here on the left, there is a \"Realtime Off\" for whatever reason,\n",
        "2:26:16\n",
        "I have no idea why. But yeah, well, live demos, I guess. I mean like let me show you how it works right now OK it doesn't work.\n",
        "2:26:24\n",
        "But then I hit Realtime Off. Oh, no. Now, does it go?\n",
        "2:26:30\n",
        "Does it go? Is it better? Yay. It does.\n",
        "2:26:35\n",
        "So you can move around. It's entirely different controls. You scroll up, do both left and right mouse button,\n",
        "2:26:43\n",
        "and move and drag like hitting-- you're holding Control or Alt or Shift,\n",
        "2:26:48\n",
        "I guess, in Control I guess it was in the Editor. And scroll in, scroll out.\n",
        "2:26:54\n",
        "It's not great in terms of controls. But I proved the point. I mean, you can have a viewport there.\n",
        "2:27:00\n",
        "So and I believe this is also why it doesn't work. When you put it in here.\n",
        "2:27:06\n",
        "It does, but very slowly. You don't see this real-time. So maybe just because of this not being calculated so as\n",
        "2:27:14\n",
        "much as the other stuff is. I got it.\n",
        "2:27:19\n",
        "I got it. I made it. So that's it, basically. Sorry. Let's get back to the questions that we haven't even started.\n",
        "2:27:27\n",
        "TINA WISDOM: No, that was perfect. KRZYSZTOF PACHULSKI: It works! TINA WISDOM: I'm glad we were able to figure it out. [LAUGHTER]\n",
        "2:27:33\n",

        "2:34:16\n",
        "I mean, so that's why Python I think is great, because it's just so simple, clean.\n",

        "It also forces you to write a clean code, kind of forces-- you can mess it up, of course.\n",

        "2:34:41\n",
        "yeah, yeah, of course. But still, I mean, if you have something more complex, go to C++. If you have something less complex, go to Blueprints.\n",

        "2:35:20\n",
        "So currently, we live in a world where there's so many technologies that solve everything for us\n",

        "that we need to pick which one is the best. And there is none that we can just master\n",

        "when you're learning to program. Because you just need to get into the new world.\n",

        "2:37:15\n",
        "that it needed to. I think you're completely right in that there's not really\n",
